Department of Homeland Security Says, “Disable Java”
January2013
TheComputerEmergencyReadinessTeam (CERT)oftheU.S.DepartmentofHomelandSecurity(DHS)
has issued an alert urging computer users to disable Java in their browsers. This unprecedented action
followed the discovery of a serious Java vulnerability that allows hackers to infect PCs with malicious
code.Thevulnerabilityhasexistedundetectedforsometime.

The Announcement
On Thursday, January 10, 2013, the DHS issued US-CERT Alert TA13-010A, Oracle Java 7 Security
Manager Bypass Vulnerability.1 This security hole in Java 7 allows hackers to install malicious code for
key logging; for stealing sensitive personal information such as credit card numbers, social security
numbers,andbankaccountnumbers;andforothercybercriminalactions.
The vulnerability is being actively exploited. Explicit code is available in “exploit kits,” which are
prepackaged, for-sale toolkits that can be used to install malicious code. Infection is generally
accomplishedbyattractingvictimstoinfectedwebsites.
Windows, MAC OS, and Linux systems are all affected. The risks include all versions of Java 7 through
Update11andthefollowingJavasystems:
JavaPlatformStandardEdition7(JavaSE7)
JavaSEDevelopmentKit(JDK7)
JavaSERuntimeEnvironment(JRE7)
WebbrowsersusingJava7plug-ins
EarlierversionsofJava,fromJava6andbefore,areunaffected.
The Vulnerability
The vulnerability is caused by a weakness in the way Java 7 restricts permissions of Java applets. It
allows a Java applet to grant itself permission to execute arbitrary code. By using this vulnerability, an
untrusted Java applet can escalate its privileges without requiring code signing. Unprivileged Java code
then can have unrestrained access to restricted classes. As a result, an attacker can execute any
commandsitchoosesonavulnerablesystem.

Attackers employ social engineering techniques to entice a user to visit an infected web site hosting a
malicious Java applet. Alternatively, the attacker can infect a legitimate site with a malicious applet. In

Recommended Actions
TheDHS’srecommendationtofixthisproblemissimple–disableJava7.
Starting with Java 7 Update 10 (J7u10), it is straightforward to disable Java content in web browsers
through the Java control applet. However, earlier versions of Java do not provide such an obvious
disabling mechanism. The DHS Alert referenced above and CERT’s Vulnerability Note 636312, Oracle
Java JRE 1.7 Expression.execute() and SunToolkit.getField() fail to restrict access to privileged code,3
provideguidancefordisablingearlierversionsofJava.
Java 7 Update 11 (J7u11) has been enhanced to set the default Java security settings to “High” so that
users will be prompted before running unsigned or self-signed Java applets. Furthermore, on Sunday,
January 13th, three days after the DHS alert, Oracle released an emergency update to correct the
problem.However,even withthesefixes,CERT continuedtorecommenddisablingJava.Its Vulnerability
Note625617containsthefollowingadvice:
“Unless it is absolutely necessary to run Java in web browsers, disable it as described below, even
after updating to 7u11. This will help mitigate other Java vulnerabilities that maybe discovered in the
future.”
In fact, vulnerabilities do continue to be discovered. Several security firms have already discovered
additionalvulnerabilitiesinJava7Update11thatcanbeexploitedtobypassJava’ssecuritysandboxand
execute arbitrarycodeoncomputers.Workingproof-of-conceptexploitcodehas been providedtoOracle
aslateastheendofJanuary.
Security experts have been advising for some time to disable Java since it is so commonly targeted by
cyber criminals. Most platforms do not come with Java, and by and large the common activities upon
whichcomputerusersdependdonotuseJava.Thus,disablingJavashouldhavelittleeffectifanyonthe
averageuser.
Some computer vendors are being proactive in attacking this problem. Last fall, Apple issued a MAC OS
update that prevents Java from running in its browsers at all. On Friday, January 11th, the day following
the DHS alert, Mozilla announced it was blocking all recent Java programs from automatically loading in
itsFirefoxbrowserunlessauserspecificallyallowsit.

Summary
According to security software maker Kaspersky Labs, Java is the most frequently attacked piece of
software and accounted for 50% of all cyber attacks in 2012. Kaspersky Labs is the Russian security
companythatdiscoveredthedevastatingStuxnetvirus.4
Security experts say that Oracle’s Java 7 problem was caused by “an incomplete patch developers
issued last year to fix an earlier (similar) security bug” (see CERT’s Vulnerability Note VU#636312
referencedabove).
Rarelydoes a government agencyrecommend the disabling of software. This action clearlyindicates the
severity of the vulnerability. Even worse, DHS says that it is currently unaware of a practical solution to
theproblem.
