# Summary of June 8 outage 

We experienced a global outage due to an undiscovered software bug that
surfaced on June 8 when it was triggered by a valid customer
configuration change. We detected the disruption within one minute, then
identified and isolated the cause, and disabled the configuration.
Within 49 minutes, 95% of our network was operating as normal.

This outage was broad and severe, and we're truly sorry for the impact
to our customers and everyone who relies on them.

### **What happened?** 

On May 12, we began a software deployment that introduced a bug that
could be triggered by a specific customer configuration under specific
circumstances.

Early June 8, a customer pushed a valid configuration change that
included the specific circumstances that triggered the bug, which caused
85% of our network to return errors.

Here's a timeline of the day's activity (all times are in UTC): 

**09:47** Initial onset of global disruption\
**09:48** Global disruption identified by Fastly monitoring\
**09:58** [[Status
post]{.underline}](https://status.fastly.com/incidents/vpk0ssybt3bj) is published\
**10:27** Fastly Engineering identified the customer configuration\
**10:36** Impacted services began to recover\
**11:00** Majority of services recovered\
**12:35** Incident mitigated\
**12:44** Status post resolved\
**17:25** Bug fix deployment began

Once the immediate effects were mitigated, we turned our attention to
fixing the bug and communicating with our customers. We created a
permanent fix for the bug and began deploying it at 17:25.

### **Where do we go from here? ** 

In the short term:

-   We're deploying the bug fix across our network as quickly and safely
    as possible. 

-   We are conducting a complete post mortem of the processes and
    practices we followed during this incident. 

-   We'll figure out why we didn't detect the bug during our software
    quality assurance and testing processes.

-   We'll evaluate ways to improve our remediation time.

We have been --- and will continue to --- innovate and invest in
fundamental changes to the safety of our underlying platforms. Broadly,
this means fully leveraging the isolation [capabilities of WebAssembly
and
Compute@Edge](/press/press-releases/fastly-expands-webassembly-investment) to build greater resiliency from the ground up. We'll continue
to update our community as we make progress toward this goal.

### **Conclusion** 

Even though there were specific conditions that triggered this outage,
we should have anticipated it. We provide mission critical services, and
we treat any action that can cause service issues with the utmost
sensitivity and priority. We apologize to our customers and those who
rely on them for the outage and sincerely thank the community for its
support. Customers should always feel free to email support@fastly.com
