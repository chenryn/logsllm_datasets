Casa Ley Upgrades to Active/Active OmniPayments
January2013
Casa Ley is one of Mexico’s largest, privately held grocery-store chains. It operates
almost 200 supermarkets that serve over forty cities in Mexico. The company has over
22,000employees.
Theretailer initiallyturnedtoHSBC as itsacquiringbank toprovideandmanageitspoint-
of-sale (POS) terminals. The terminals offer many services to the retailer’s customers
beyond paying for in-store purchases with credit cards and debit cards. For instance, cell
phones canbetoppedoff,bank deposits canbemade,and bills canbe paidonlineatthe
cashregister.
Casa Ley subsequently decided to provide its own transaction-
authorization switch to save card transaction fees and turned to
ACI Worldwide’s BASE24 system running on HP NonStop servers
for this purpose. When ACI announced its termination of support
for BASE24 on NonStop servers, Casa Ley upgraded its
transaction-authorization switch to Opsol’s OmniPayments and
realized several additional benefits in the process. The primary
benefits were upgrading to a modern, active/active solution

Casa Ley Moves to BASE24
Inthe year 2000,CasaLeydecidedtopurchaseand manageits ownPOSterminals sothatitcouldhave
anegotiationadvantagewithitsacquiringbank forcredit-cardanddebit-cardtransactionfees.Thissaved
the retailer considerable sums of money. It turned to ACI Worldwide’s BASE24 electronic-funds
processingsystemrunningonanHPNonStopservertomanageitsterminals.
Though normally employed by the financial-payments industry to authorize card transactions, the
BASE24 system was used by Casa Ley for this same purpose. Its card transactions were routed to the
issuingbanks byits BASE24system for authorization, thus bypassingtheretailer’s acquiringbank.Atthe
end of each day, the transaction logs from the BASE24 system were sent to the retailer’s acquiring bank
for clearing and settlement with the issuing banks. The funds due Casa Ley for its day’s selling activities
weredepositedinitsmerchantaccountheldbyitsacquiringbank.
The BASE24 architecture employed by Casa Ley is shown in Figure 1. Each grocery store had several
(typically, a dozen or more) POS terminals. The transaction traffic from the POS terminals within a store
was concentrated by an in-store server and was sent to the BASE24 system via the VISA 2 protocol, a
proprietarycommunicationprotocol.

The BASE24 application was hosted
on an HP NonStop server located at
CasaLey’sheadquarters.
When a transaction was initiated at a
POS terminal, its data was sent by the
store server to the BASE24 system.
BASE24 sent the transaction via the
PROSA or E-Global transaction-
authorization network to the
appropriate issuing bank for
authorization. Aresponse was returned
to the POS terminal to accept or reject
thecardtransaction.
As mentioned earlier, the POS
terminals supported many additional
services – cell-phone topping, bank
deposits, bill payments, and others.
The store clerk entered the transaction
data for each of these transaction
types into the POS terminal under the
control of the in-store server, which
then took the necessary steps to
completethetransaction.
In addition to the retailer’s supermarket
stores, the system also supported what is known as correspondent banks. In Mexico, many little villages
havenosupermarkets,nobanks,andoften no Internetservice. In these villages, CasaLeyset up oneor
more local merchants with a POS terminal. The merchants could then sell goods via credit cards and
debit cards and could execute other transactions such as the cell-phone topping and banking services
mentioned above. These merchants are called correspondent banks because they extend banking
servicestothesmallvillages.
The BASE24 Sunset
A decade later, ACI announced to its BASE24 customers that it would sunset its HP NonStop BASE24
product by the end of 2011. To continue full ACI support, NonStop BASE24 customers would have to
move to ACI’s new product, BASE24-eps. BASE24-eps is an entirely new product and requires a
complexmigration.Alternatively,customerscouldmovetoBASE24onIBMz/OSmainframes.
This gave Casa Ley an opportunity to review its approach to POS terminal support. The company
decidedonseveraladditionalfeaturesthatitwouldliketohaveinanewsystem:
 It wanted to incorporate geographical redundancy so that it could provide a rapid failover
response to a system outage. If the system failed with the current implementation, Casa Ley’s
grocery stores could not accept card transactions. They could operate on a cash basis only.
Fortunately,theHPNonStopserverwasfault-tolerant;andaserverfailurewasunlikely.
 All communications between the grocerystores and the BASE24 system were unencrypted. This

 The additional customer services that the retailer wanted to provide via its POS terminals
required modifications to the in-store servers in current use. These modifications would have to

After an evaluation of its various options, Casa Ley selected Opsol Integrator’s OmniPayments financial-
transactionauthorizationsystem.
Opsol’s OmniPayments Financial-Transaction Authorization System
Opsol’s OmniPayments financialtransactionauthorizationsystem isshowninFigure2.OmniPayments is
alayeredarchitecture.Itisbuiltuponthefault-tolerantHPNonStopserver.
The core layer of OmniPayments is Opsol’s
OmniDirector Enterprise Service Bus.
OmniDirector services include data
transformation, encryption, intelligent routing, and
communication-failure recovery. It also provides
adapters to support those protocols required to
communicate with Casa Ley’s POS terminals as
well as with Mexico’s transaction interchanges
suchasPROSAandE-Global.
Business logic modules, or BLMs, supply the
business functions of OmniPayments. The
functions include credit-card and debit-card
authorization services, and the BLMs are
extensible to include the other services that Casa
Ley wanted to offer its customers via its POS
terminals.
OmniPayments provides complete logging of all
transactions. The logs contain the transaction
information needed at the end of each day for
clearing and settlement. It is this processing
function that transfers funds from the card-issuing banks to Casa Ley’s merchant account held by its
acquiringbanktoreflecttheday’ssalesactivities.
Casa Ley Upgrades to OmniPayments
OmniPayments led to many additional benefits for Casa Leyother than the initial goals noted above. The
totality of benefits can be best understood by describing the retailer’s OmniPayments configuration, as
showninFigure3.
Active/ActiveConfiguration
Two OmniPayments HP NonStop servers are configured as an active/active system. One server is
located at the retailer’s Mexican headquarters, and the other server is in a remote location some 500
miles away. Both servers are actively processing transactions, and the transaction load is normally split
betweenthem.Shouldoneserverfail,alltransactionsareimmediatelyroutedtothesurvivingserver,thus
ensuringavailabilityofthetransaction-authorizationservicestotheCasaLeystores.
Each NonStop server is responsible for authorizing the transactions routed to it. Each sends its
transaction requests to the appropriate issuing bank via either the PROSA or E-Global transaction-
authorizationnetworkandreturnstheresponsestothePOSterminalsthatoriginatedthem.

Each server logs its own transaction
activity. However, to ensure the durability
of transactions in the event of a server
failure, the transaction logs on each of the
two servers are synchronized via
bidirectional data replication. Whenever a
transaction is entered into the transaction
log of one server, it is immediately
replicated to the transaction log of the
other server. Thus, each server has a
record of all transactions made by both
servers. This replication is performed
directly by OmniPayments – no third-party
data-replicationengineisrequired.
At the end of the day, either log may be
usedtosendtransactioninformationtothe
acquiringbankforsettlementandclearing.
CommunicationServices
The communication services required to
support this configuration are provided by
Telmex, the dominant fixed-line phone
carrier in Mexico. Each POS terminal
maintains an active connection with each
OmniPayments NonStop server and can
reroutetransactionsinstantly.
Thecorrespondentbanksaresimilarlyconnected.
The communication network normally balances the transaction load between the two OmniPayments
NonStop servers. However, should Telemex determine that the links to one server are down, Telmex
immediatelyreroutesalltraffictothesurvivingserver.Thus,recoveryfromaserveroutageismeasuredin

SimplifiedStore-ClerkProcedures
All POS terminal functions are now provided by OmniPayments. In addition to transaction authorization,
BLMs were written to implement the ancillary services such as cell-phone topping and banking services
offeredbytheretailerthroughitsPOSterminals.
As a consequence, the store-clerk procedures have been standardized and simplified and result in a
morepositivecustomerexperience.
PCIDSSCompliance
OmniPayments implemented a component on the POS terminal to support encryption. All transmissions
between the POS terminals and OmniPayments are now encrypted, as are all transmissions between
OmniPayments and the transaction-authorization networks. OmniPayments totally supports encryption,
andCasaLeyisnowPCIDSS-compliant.

TotalCostofOwnership
Casa Ley’s costs to operate and maintain the system have been reduced significantly by savings in its
license fees. This is because ACI’s pricing model is based on the peak transaction rate experienced
during the previous year, whereas Opsol’s pricing model is not based on transaction rate. It is based on
thenumberofNonStopprocessorsusedintheOmniPaymentsservers.
