RushCards are prepaid debit cards used by people who typically do not have bank accounts. The debit
cards are periodically loaded with payroll money and government benefits. A technical glitch prevented
access to these funds by the cardholders. Without bank accounts or other financial resources to which

What Is a RushCard?
PrepaidDebitCards
Prepaid debit cards are used to distribute money to millions of people around the world. It is their only
source of cash, as they typically do not have bank accounts. In 2012, American prepaid debit cards held
atotalof$65billion;andtwelvemillionAmericansdependeduponthem fortheirfinancialwell-being.This
was a doubling of the number of prepaid debit cardholders in just three years. That explosive growth
continuestoday.
Prepaid debit cards are specifically aimed at the unbanked and underbanked. These people are not tied
to a bank account. Getting prepaid debit cards does not involve a credit check. They can be purchased
online and loaded with money electronically. Employers can direct-deposit payroll checks to the cards.
The cards are more convenient than cash or checks. They can be used at stores, online, or anywhere
that a normal debit card can be used. Best of all, in the U.S., they are insured by the FDIC (the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation) so that deposits are protected. This is accomplished via the FDIC
insurancecarriedbythebanksthatissuethecards.
There are some shortfalls to prepaid debit cards. They do not fall under the same regulations as bank
cards.Infact,theregulations thatare appliedto prepaiddebitcards areless stringentthanthose that are
applied to normal debit cards or credit cards. They are not backed up by a traditional bank account,

The unbanked are adults who do not have their own bank accounts. Nearly half have had checking
accountsforciblyclosed,ortheyhaveclosedaccountsthemselvesduetooverdraftfees.
The underbanked are a distinct group from the unbanked. They have bank accounts but are unsatisfied
with the current services they receive from their banks. Many of the underbanked find that their current
accountoverdraftfacilitieshavebeenreducedorremovedalltogether.
In 2013, the FDIC estimated that there were over 10 million people in the U.S. who had no bank account
(the unbanked) and that 58 million Americans were underbanked. These numbers have been
exacerbatedbymanybanksthataresheddinglower-incomecustomersinordertoreducetheirregulatory

RushCards
To fill the needs of the unbanked and underbanked, prepaid debit
cards came into use. Predominant among these cards is the
RushCard.
The RushCard was introduced in 2003 by Russell Simmons, a self-
made multimillionaire. Born in 1957, Russell Simmons is a major
figure in the Hip-Hop world. In fact, he is the third richest figure in Hip
Hop with an estimated net worth of $340 million. He aimed his
marketing messages at a very specific crowd, the black and hispanic
Americansthatmakeupadisproportionateamountofthecountry’spoor.
The issuing bank for RushCards is MetaBank. Metabank operates ten retail branches in Iowa and South
Dakota. It offers traditional banking services designed to serve the needs of individual, agricultural, and
businessdepositorsandborrowers.
The purpose of RushCards, Simmons says, is to help the millions of Americans who are unable or
unwillingtoparticipateinthecountry’straditionalbankingsystem.TheRushCardwebsitestates:
“There are 68 million Americans who cannot or choose not to establish a traditional banking
relationship. We believe that every American should have access to an affordable place to keep
theirhard-earnedmoney–onethatissafeandconvenient.”
Hundreds of thousands of cardholders use RushCards, and cardholders do not have to pay to cash their
paychecks.However,feesareassociatedwithsomeusesofRushCards:

The RushCard Glitch
TheRushCardproblems startedover the2015Columbus Dayweekendas RushCard was changingfrom
one technology provider to another. During the conversion, on October 11th, thousands of accounts were
wrongly deactivated. The account information of thousands of others was erroneously changed.
RushCardusersdiscoveredthattheirbalanceswerezeroeventhoughtheyknewthattheyhadmoneyon
theircards.
RushCard users couldn’t get through to customer service because of the volume of complaints. Direct
deposits were returned to company payroll departments or to government benefits administrators
becausetheaccountsdidn’texist.
Without other financial resources, RushCard cardholders were left without money to pay rent, buy
groceries, or put gas in their cars. Without gas, many cardholders couldn’t get to work and faced loss of
their jobs. Their only recourse in many cases was to turn to the loans of last resort – payroll loans that
chargedusuriousinterestrates.
A woman in Philadelphia was turned away at McDonald’s to her embarrassment. A woman in Decatur,
Georgia, could not pay for her husband’s heart medication. An autoworker in Detroit accepted food from
colleagues because she had no money to buy her own food. Across the country, hundreds of thousands
ofpoorpeoplefacedchallengessimilartothese.
It took over ten days for RushCard to correct its technical problems. For well over a week, hundreds of
thousandsofAmericanshadnoaccesstocashtoleadtheirlives.
Aftertendayshadpassed,RushCardchiefexecutiveRickSlavardissuedastatementsaying:
“The vast majority of customers have had their issues resolved. There are a handful of customers
who still can’t access account information. Their funds are there, but their information is still
inaccurate.Weareworkingtocontactthemindividuallytoassistthemwiththeirneeds.”
RushCard emphasized that its customers’ money was protected by FDIC insurance. Therefore, no
customer had to fear that his money was lost (assuming RushCard was able to restore all of the
deactivated accounts, which it evidently was successful in doing). As an apology, RushCard waived card
feesforitscardholdersforseveralmonths.Inaddition,itcreatedamulti-milliondollarfundtocompensate
customers for their losses. Russell Simmons acknowledged that, though this fund would cost him a lot of
money,itwasjustonewayofregainingthetrustofhisloyalbase.
The Movement toward Better Consumer Protection
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) strongly noted that the RushCard situation was

Coincidently, in November 2014, the CFPB had issued proposed guidelines to tighten regulations on
prepaiddebitcards.Upontheissuanceoftheseproposals,itstated:
“Consumers are increasingly relying on prepaid products to make purchases and access funds, but
they are not guaranteed the same protections or disclosures as traditional bank accounts. Our

proposal would close the loopholes in this market and ensure prepaid consumers are protected

TheproposedCFPBregulationswould:
 Require prepaid companies to limit consumer losses when cards are lost or stolen or when
fraudulentpurchasesaremade.
 Providefreeaccesstoaccountinformationsuchasbalances.
 Improve error-resolution procedures, and credit consumers if card issues cannot be immediately
