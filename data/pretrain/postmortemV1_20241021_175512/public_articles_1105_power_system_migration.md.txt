Migrating IBM Power Systems to HPE Open Systems
May2016
Hewlett Packard has several decades of experience in migrating mission-critical applications from IBM
PowerSystemstoHP(andnowHPEnterprise)opensystems.HPEhasdemonstratedthatthemajorityof
such migrations result in a significantly less expensive operating environment – often by a factor
exceeding 50%. At the same time, the new HPE open environments match or exceed the performance
andavailabilityattributesoftheoriginalPowerSystems.

Compelling Reasons for Migrating from Power Systems
There are several pain points that are encouraging organizations to consider moving their mission-critical
applicationsfromIBMPowerSystemstoopensystems.
DwindlingISVSupport

of ISVs that are supporting UNIX applications is shrinking every year.TheGartner Group predicts that by
the year 2020, there will be a 70% reduction in applications running on UNIX. As time goes on, vendors

IBM claims that you can run Linux applications on Power Systems. However, Power Linux
implementations are not binary compatible with mainstream Linux distributions on x86 platforms. Linux

HighCost
By offering both x86 and cloud operating environments, HPE allows customers to maintain their mission-
critical service-level agreements (SLAs) with vastly lower costs for software licensing, hardware support,
andpowerconsumption.
Of special importance is the cost of the Oracle database management system. Many of the applications
beingmigrateduse anOracledatabase.Oraclecharges twiceas muchper CPU for Power Systems than
it does for x86 platforms. Furthermore, Oracle RAC (Real Application Cluster) costs $11,500 on an x86
and$23,000percoreonanIBMPowerSystem.

SupportforCloudComputing
Moving workloads to a cloud environment requires defining a virtualized, standardized platform to deploy
applications onto a wide range of public cloud-service providers. If workloads remain on Power Systems,
then the only cloud-deployment option is a high-cost cloud from IBM. Since cloud computing requires a
common set of software across all platforms, Power Systems cannot be brought readily into this flexible
environment. Tools for publicly available clouds environments such as Microsoft’s Hyper-V, ESX from
VMware,andXenfromCitrixrunonLinuxand/orWindows,notPowerSystems.
HPE’s Approach to Migration
A fundamental requirement of migration is that the services provided by an application continue
uninterruptedduringandafterthemigration.Oftentimes,workloadsforlargeapplicationscanbemigrated

decision that is to be determined for each migration. Often, several migrations must be planned and
executed,andthemixofparticipantsmayvarywitheach.

a migration. This approach can reduce risk and provide a single point of ownership for the migration
project. Migrating from Power Systems to open systems requires knowledge of many application
environments, including online transaction processing, batch processing, and enterprise resource
planning(ERP),allofwhichneedtobeaccessedon-demandandcannotbedown.
It becomes more complicated if the client wants to assign some of its IT personnel to the migration. The
HPEapproachletstheclientdecidetheextenttowhichitsstaffparticipatesinthemigration.
HandlingApplicationChangesDuringaMigration
In many cases, in addition to migrating from Power Systems to open systems, the client may want to
upgrade its applications. This can involve changing third-party packages, replacing a custom application
withathird-partyapplication,ormodifyingacustomapplication.
In general, it is advisable to migrate the application first before changing it. This minimizes risk since
there are no logic changes being made. Unless an application is no longer suitable for production, it is
better to leave re-engineering until after the migration, since re-engineering will onlyextend the migration
timeframe.
In-HouseDevelopedCode
A common high-risk area is the migration of in-house developed code that is older and mission critical.
HPE has developed a portfolio of software tools that automates the migration of in-house code including
C,Java,andscripts.
Clients willoftendecidetomigratein-housecodeiftheyhaveonlyasmallnumberofapplicationsorifthe
applications are not mission critical. If the customer decides to perform its own migrations from Power
Systems to HPE open systems, then it must recompile the applications and run functional and system

testingor,evenworse,inproduction.

HPE has developed code analysis tools that reduce the time and effort of a manual review process.
These tools identify the dependencies and required code changes of an application prior to migrating
from Power Systems toopensystems.Ithas been demonstratedthat thesetools canreduce testing time
by as much as 70%. The tool set is especially appropriate to analyze mission-critical code since it

ISVApplications
For packaged applications from vendors such as SAP, Oracle, and dozens of others, the vendor typically
offers services to migrate the application to Linux on x86. However, a major application from a vendor
typically uses many other services such as WebSphere, MQ, or SQL databases. The vendor doesn’t
necessarily offer services for these migrations. Not only must all of these services be migrated, but they
mustendupstillworkingwitheachotherafterthemigration.
HPE can manage the migration of the entire ecosystem – applications, application servers, middleware,
databases, and other components. It has tools to support the migration of DB2 databases on Power
Systemstootherdatabases.
SuperdomeX
ISV applications that run on both Power Systems and Linux on x86 are easily migrated to HPE Linux
systemssuchastheHPEIntegrityProLiantseries.
The x86-based Superdome X supports industry standard operating environments like Linux and
Windows, but draws upon decades of HPE’s UNIX server experience, delivering levels of availability,
processing power, and serviceability typically found only on UNIX platforms with proprietary processors.
For example, a Superdome X can be divided into electronically isolated partitions called nPars. Each
partition runs its own copy of the operating system and applications in isolation from the other partitions,

A comparison of costs of an IBM Power System and an equivalent Superdome X system shows a TCO
(total cost of ownership) savings of 41%. This includes a 75% reduction in hardware costs, a 38%
reduction in software costs, and a 30% reduction in software support costs. In addition, there are the

Case Studies
PharmacyChain
A chain of pharmacies has separate operations for wholesale distribution and retail functions. It had long
relied on SAP for ERP and customer relationshipmanagement(CRM) runningon IBMDB2 under AIX on
PowerSystems.
The company moved to SAP HANA and off its legacy databases to reduce costs and to increase
scalability and flexibility. They moved to a Superdome X with two nPars – one for the wholesale
operations and onefor the retailoperations. Eachhas differentrequirements interms of concurrentusers
