# Footnotes 

-   [[1](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_1) During the
    Apollo moon missions, transient and unexpected behaviors were called
    \'funnies\' and identifying and characterizing them was important
    for mission success, cf. Apollo 17 Mission Commentary, 12/10/72 at
    CST 7:31 and elsewhere. \[Full text of \"NASA Audio Highlight Reels,
    Soundbites and Launch Sounds\",
    https://archive.org/stream/NasaAudioHighlightReels/AS17_PAO_djvu.txt,
    accessed 15 June 2017.\]]
-   [[2](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_2) To be sure, such
    plans are often notional or even intentionally misleading,
    especially when they are coupled to regulatory requirements or
    political agendas (see Lee Clarke\'s Mission Improbable: Using
    Fantasy Documents to Tame Disaster. Chicago: University of Chicago
    Press, 2001).]
-   [[3](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_3) For example, to
    use unpurified water to cool the reactor at Fukashima would damage
    the reactor beyond repair resulting in a total loss. Failing to cool
    the reactor, however, would eventually result in a large release of
    radioactivity into the environment. Ultimately one of the reactor
    units was cooled with unpurified water but the decision was taken
    late enough that a substantial release occurred.]
-   [[4](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_4) An early reader
    of this report noted that \'todo\' lists are controversial and that
    postmortems are sometimes \'pressurized by the need to report out
    and assign specific action items.\' In an effort to reduce that
    pressure, at least one organization the postmortem process has been
    split into two separate meetings, one for the analysis portion of
    the postmortem and a separate meeting to discuss remediation
    actions.]
-   [[5](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_5) An early reader
    commented \"There\'s the related, but different
    'how-did-this-ever-work?!' experience that is even more troubling
    upon discovery. You make a change to restore function to a system
    but are unable to construct a mental model that would have ever
    allowed the system to work correctly before you fixed it \-- in
    direct opposition to the observation that the system did appear to
    be functioning previously.\"]
-   [[6](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_6) An early reader
    of this report pointed out that there are organizations where the
    term postmortem is applied to a single individual writing a report
    using a template. This is one consequence of terminological
    popularity.]
-   [[7](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_7) For a more
    detailed account of the reactions to failure and their significance,
    see Woods et al. Behind Human Error, Section V.]
-   [[8](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_8) There are many
    fields where there are short periods of high tempo that punctuate
    longer periods of low tempo. \"Long periods of boredom punctuated by
    moments of sheer terror\" is a description that applies to
    anesthesia practice, commercial piloting, etc., and, it appears,
    also to devops settings!]
-   [[9](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_9) There was once a
    heated debate about whether color displays were enough better than
    monochrome displays to justify their use. The pace of development
    made the issue moot. For example, see Stokes AF, Wickens CD,
    Aviation Displays, in Nagel DC, Weiner EL, eds. Human Factors in
    Aviation. San Diego, CA: Academic Press, 1988, pp.
    409-416.]
-   [[10](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_10)For example
    when one customer of a SaaS vendor began emitting a high volume of
    API calls that severely impact the service performance for other
    customers the vendor\'s responders decided to block that customer's
    network traffic until the customer could throttle the requests.
    Refusing service to a customer because providing it would result in
    widespread damage is a sacrifice strategy. A similar strategy is the
    use of \"[rolling
    blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout)\"
    to prevent wide system failure when power demand exceeds
    supply.]
-   [[11](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_11)Cunningham W,
    personal communication, 2017.]
-   [[12](http://snafucatchers.github.io/#foot_return_12)Dark debt was
    named that to draw a parallel with [dark
    matter](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy).
    Dark matter has detectable effects on the world but cannot be seen
    or detected directly. Matter that can be seen and measured directly
    accounts for only about 15% of the mass of the universe; the
    remaining 80% is dark matter. Dark matter is widely distributed in
    the universe. It is responsible for the shapes of galaxies \--
    indeed for the fact that galaxies exist at all! \-- yet it can only
    be detected by the gravitational effect it has on other, non-dark,
    matter. Dark matter was [suggested by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 and
    confirmed by the measurements of Rubin and Ford in the
    1970\'s](http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/011330/dark-matter).]
