2012, which was held in Las Vegas from June 4th through June 7th. At Discover 2012, attendees learned
all that is new in HP’s converged infrastructure initiative. However, Discover 2012 had to cover so much
material about so many topics that any one particular niche could be given only limited exposure. This is
thepurposeofthe2013OpenVMSBootCamp–todrilldownintoallthingsOpenVMS.
The educational opportunities are only some of the reasons for attending the Boot Camp. This is an
