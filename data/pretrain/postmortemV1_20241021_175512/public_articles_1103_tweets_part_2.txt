Yourinfrastructure'sinthecloudandtheInternetgoesdown.Nowwhat?
We've come to expect Internet connectivity to be available because the provision of it has become
so cheap. And that expectation has led us to become reliant on it.When the Internet is down for us,
many of the things we do are unavailable. This reliance on the Internet has made planning for the
lack of it complicated. Many organizationsare, in effect, crossing theirfingersrather than planning in
earnest.

“Late yesterday afternoon, our trusted Cisco 5505 stopped working. Poof. Red Status light on;
