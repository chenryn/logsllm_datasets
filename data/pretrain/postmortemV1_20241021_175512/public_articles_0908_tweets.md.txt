– Our August Twitter Feed of Outages
August2014
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

At the 2008 DEFCON hackers’ conference, security researchers demonstrated a fairly simple
technique to divert Internet traffic to an eavesdropping site on its way to the intended recipient.
Thoughthisvulnerabilityhadbeenearlierpredicted,noonehadeverbeenabletodemonstrateit.
The problem is in a vulnerability of BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol. BGP is the routing protocol
used to distribute global routing information throughout the Internet. It is used by all major ISPs as

causing the disruption. Instead, structural problems with one of the core technologies that keeps the
Internetworkingweretoblame,researcherssay.

ThedaytheInternetbroke
On August 12th, Verizon, a major US Internet service provider (ISP), did something relatively
mundane and technical: it took some big groups of IP addresses, which we can think of as the
phone numbers of the Internet, one of which is designated to every desktop computer, tablet or
smartphone – and divided them up into smaller blocks to free up some unused addresses. In doing
so,throughnofaultofitsown,VerizonbroketheInternet(abit).

MakingClustersEasytoUseandEasytoOwn
Companies have more choices than ever to save money and improve efficiency in their IT
environment. However, protecting business critical applications from downtime and disasters in
these environments poses a variety of challenges to traditional SAN-based cluster environments.
Companies should rethink their approach to high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) and
consideralternativesthatdonotrequiretheuseofsharedstorage.
