Oracle Releases Massive Security Patch for Java
May2013
Following last January’s recommendation by the U.S. Department of
HomelandSecurity(DHS) todisableJavainbrowsers,1Oraclenowhas come
out with a massive set of patches to try to plug Java security holes. These
patches have been released in Oracle’s April 2013 Critical Patch Update
(CPU) for Java SE. The release is an attempt to halt ongoing hacker attacks

April 2013 Critical Patch Update for Java SE
Oracle releases CPUs every quarter, with special patch releases provided more frequently if critical
vulnerabilities are found. On April 16th, Oracle released its April 2013 Critical Patch Update for Java SE.
Affected Java versions include Java 5 (Update 41) and earlier, Java 6 (Update 43) and earlier, and Java
7 (Update 17) and earlier. The release comes a few months after Facebook, Twitter, and NBC News

The April 2013 CPU for Java SE addresses forty-two security flaws. Thirty-nine vulnerabilities were
remotely exploitable without authentication (username and password). These vulnerabilities would have
allowed a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code, to cause a denial-of-service, or to
gainunauthorizedaccesstoacompany’sfilesorsystems.
Nineteen of these vulnerabilities carried a CVSS score of ten. CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring
System) is a widely used standard for rating security vulnerabilities. It considers how easy it is to launch
an attack and the impact of a successful attack using a vulnerability. The highest CVSS score is ten. A
value of ten indicates that an easy, over-the-network, unauthenticated takeover of the operating system
canbemade.
Thus,almosthalf of the vulnerabilities that werepatchedbythe April 2013 CPU for Java SE were as bad

The April 2013 patches address vulnerabilities that were found during this year’s Pwn2Own competition.
Pwn2Own is a computer-hacking contest held annually at the CanSecWest Security Conference.
Contestants are challenged to exploit widely used software and mobile devices with previously unknown
vulnerabilities

Java has now surpassed Adobe Reader as the most frequently attacked piece of software. In 2011,
Adobe Reader accounted for 35% of attacks compared to Java’s 25%. In 2012, 50% of the attacks were
madeagainstJavaascomparedto28%madeagainstAdobeReader.
April 2013 Critical Patch Update
On the same day that it released its Java SE patch, Oracle also released its April 2013 Critical Patch
Update, which applied 128 patches tothirteen of its productsuites. Patched products includedtheOracle
Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Supply Chain Products Suite,
Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise, Oracle Siebel CRM, Oracle FLEXCUBE, Oracle Industry Applications,
OraclePrimavera,OracleandSunSystemsProductSuite,OracleMySQL,andOracleSupportTools.
Several of these patches had CVSS scores of ten. Four addressed Oracle database security
vulnerabilitiesthatcouldbeexploitedremotelywithoutausernameorpassword.

The Java ecosystem pioneered many new features that made developing software for multiple platforms

As H. D. Moore, chief security officer at Rapid 7 explains,2 "The Java sandbox was designed when the
threat to desktop users was verydifferent. The current generation of sandboxes (Chrome, Adobe, IE) are
implemented one level higher -- restricting what the sandboxed process can do and not trying to enforce
all of the logic within the runtime itself. Java's sandbox is still of the older variety. All it takes is one logic

Nevertheless, if you are committed to Java, as many companies are, the number of patches in the April
2013 CPUs can seem overwhelming. Experts suggest that you patch the Internet-exposed services first.
Then consider the highest severity patches – those with a CVSS score of ten, followed by patches of
lessorseverity.
