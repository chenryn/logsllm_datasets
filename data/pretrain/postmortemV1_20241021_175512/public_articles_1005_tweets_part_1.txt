– Our May Twitter Feed of Outages
May2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

AvailabilityDigestOldiebutGoodie:"Hacked APTweetCrashesMarkets"
From 2013: On Tuesday, April 23, 2013, an Associated Press (AP) tweet reported that President
Obama had been injured in an explosion at the White House. It sent the U.S. financial markets into
an instant tailspin. Fortunately, the tweet was false. The AP Twitter account had been hacked.
However, what does this mean for “flash crashes” in the future when unverified and perhaps
maliciousinformationisdisseminatedviasocialmedia?

Lastmonth,a securityresearchertweeted from aUnitedAirlines plane thatsecuritycontrolswere so
lax that he could hack into the system and make the oxygen masks fall. At the time, Airbus, the
plane’smanufacturer,said there wasn’tanyreal securityissue.Surprise! During an earlierflight,the
security researcher actuallydidseize control of the aircraftand caused it to briefly fly sideways,
accordingtoanFBIsearchwarrantapplication.

The ‘Power Attack’: how to take down a data centre with practically no hacking
The central premise of the Power Attack is that data centres are augmented ad hoc overa period of
yearsaccordingto demand and othermarketfactorsandthatthemodularityand scalabilitydesigned
into racking and other commercial facets of the operation is not similarly applied to power
provisioning – leaving scope for attackers to cause damaging power crises without any special

AvailabilityDigestOldiebutStillGoodie:"Anti-Virus–ASinglePointofFailure?"
What do active/active systems, clusters, fault-tolerant systems, and standby systems have in
common? They all avoid a single point of failure. True, fault-tolerant systems and clusters will not
survive a site failure; and standby systems have been known not to come up when needed. But
active/active systems are immune, right? On April 21, 2010, McAfee, one of the leading antivirus
vendors,provedthisconjecturetobewrong.

TheGovernmentDoublesDownonCybersecurityLeadership(IndustryPerspective)
For the U.S. Federal Government, 2015 is quickly turning into the year of cybersecurity. Though
heralded with less fanfare, it’s also the year of cybersecurity for the state and local market. That’s
because the feds are pushing cyberthreat information-sharing among companies and among
governmentsspanningthepublicandprivatesectors.
