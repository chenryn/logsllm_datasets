Bank-Verlag’s two data centers in Germany utilize a broad range of systems from multiple vendors.
Included in these systems are several HP NonStop servers. Bank-Verlag wanted to have a common
monitoring facility to manage all of its systems and settled on the open-source Nagios monitoring
application. Though Nagios supports the company’s wide range of Windows, Unix, and Linux systems, it
didnotsupportNonStop.
In order to integrate its NonStop servers into the Nagios monitoring facility, Bank-Verlag created its own
monitoring subsystem for NonStop and calls it “BVmonitoring.“ BVmonitoring provides the functionality of
a Nagios agent along with significant infrastructure to gather the events and statistics that Nagios needs
in order to perform its monitoring functions. Bank-Verlag data center-administrators now can monitor and
managetheir NonStop servers inthe samemanner as their other IT systems andwith no requirementfor
specialin-depthknowledgeofNonStopsystems.
Bank-Verlag
Bank-Verlag(www.bank-verlag.de) is asubsidiaryof anassociationof over 300Germanbanks,including
DeutscheBank andall other largebanks inGermany. Itwas establishedin1961tobethepublishingarm
for the association and published a banking magazine, “Die Bank,” which was distributed to the
association’s member banks.1 Bank-Verlag is now the IT-service provider for all the private banks in
Germany.
In 1985, the banking association requested that Bank-Verlag build a central authorization system for the
banks’ debit cards. Bank-Verlag did so using an IBM System 370 that was available in its data center.
However, as the need for continuous availability of its card services became apparent, Bank-Verlag
movedthisfunctiontoaTandem(nowHPNonStop)system.
To make the move without having to take down its card-authorization services, Bank-Verlag ran the
services using the IBM 370 and the NonStop server as an active/active pair. Card transactions could be
routed to either system for authorization. Ultimately, the IBM 370 was replaced with a NonStop server as
the active/active companion. Under the guidance of Wolfgang Breidbach of Bank-Verlag, this is the first
knownactive/activesystemsofarastheAvailabilityDigestisaware.2

Nagios
Nagios3 (www.nagios.com) is an open-source facility that provides monitoring and alerting for servers,
storage devices, network components, services, and applications. Nagios was originally designed to run
under Linux but now runs under other Unix variants. Bank-Verlag has extended the Nagios monitoring
functionalitytoembraceHPNonStopservers.
The NonStop Nagios Agent
Overview
A NonStop server has many subsystems, each with its own monitoring facility. Examples of NonStop
subsystems include CPUs, storage systems, Pathway (the application monitor), TMF (Transaction
Management Facility), Lines (communication lines), and NetBatch (batch scheduling). Typically, NonStop
operators are alerted to significant events via EMS messages sent to the NonStop Event Management
Service (EMS). In order to integrate NonStop servers into Nagios, these messages are monitored by
BVmonitoring, which drives Nagios alerts to the system operators. In addition, the subsystems gather
statistics that are available for analysis. Typical statistics include CPU usage, file sizes, communication-
line loads, and transaction rates. The NonStop Nagios agent makes these statistics available to system
operators.Also,thesystemconfigurationisautomaticallydetectedandstoredinSQLtables.
Via acentralmessagecollector,the Nagios monitoringtoolfilters EMSmessages toselect those that are
appropriate. Descriptions of selected events are sent to Nagios for data center-wide monitoring. Selected
statistical information is also made available. Data can be pushed to Nagios via a secure TCP/IP
connection, or it can be pulled from a NonStop-resident file by Nagios via FTP or some other file-transfer
utility.BVmonitoringitselfisabletoautomaticallycorrectmanyproblems.
The BVmonitoring modules are all configurable, and most parameters have defaults. In most cases,
BVmonitoring can run on NonStop with just the default parameter values. Each module can be
“refreshed”toreturnitsparameterstotheirdefaulttablesandtoupdateitsconfigurationtables.

Alerts
BVmonitoring alerts users when something goes wrong and alerts them again when the situation is
corrected.Someeventscausingalertsinclude:

A parameter for EMS messages defines how many occurrences of an EMS message within a specified
timeframemustoccurinorderforanalerttoberesent.

Alerts can be delivered via SMS, email, pager, or any other method for which the user has provided a

DataTables
Statistical and configuration data is kept in SQL tables. The configuration data is refreshed whenever a
refresh command is issued to a module. The average and maximum values for statistical data such as
CPU usage and transaction rates are recorded hourly and daily. These tables can be used for reporting
viaSQLqueries,Excelspreadsheets,orotherreportingfacilities.

SystemRequirements
BVmonitoring running on NonStop requires SQL/MP. SQL/MX is an option. Measure is optional and is

BenefitsofNonStopNagios
One of the intents of the Nagios NonStop port is to minimize the specific NonStop knowledge that a
systemadministratorrequires.Forinstance,aTCP/IPconnectionwouldbereportedas:
“The TCP/IP connection with address 192.168.77.77 is configured on the controller in slot 2.4 on ‘D’
andtheporthastheMACaddress08.00.12.34.56.”

A major goal of BVmonitoring is to eliminate manual tasks wherever possible. Examples of corrective
actionsthatmightbetakenautomaticallybyBVmonitoringinclude:
 Perform a reload of a file that has become fragmented, or increase the extents available to a file

 IssueaSTARTcommandtoaPathwayserverthathasaborted.

 ReducethepriorityofaprocessthatisconsumingtoomanyCPUcycles.
 Start the entire system including all applications, using the capability to automatically start a
process.

Summary
By creating BVmonitoring for NonStop servers, Bank-Verlag is now able to monitor and manage its
NonStop systems with the same open-source management facility that it uses to manage the other data-
centersystems.NonStopserversnowarefullyintegratedintoBank-Verlag’sITinfrastructure.
BVmonitoring is more than a Nagios client. It is a general-purpose monitoring tool and can act as a client
to any system-monitoring facility. Bank-Verlag is currently in the process of modifying BVmonitoring so
thatitusesanEnscribedatabase,eliminatingtheneedforSQL/MP.
Bank-Verlag is not interested in selling BVmonitoring as a product. However, it is willing to license the
software to other users, with maintenance and support provided for a monthly or yearly fee. If anyone
would like further details concerning BVmonitoring, he or she may contact me, Wolfgang Breidbach, of
