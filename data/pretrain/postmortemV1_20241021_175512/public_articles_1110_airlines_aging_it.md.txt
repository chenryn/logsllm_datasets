Airlines’ Aging IT Technology Is Taking Its Toll
October2016
First it was Southwest Airlines. In July, 2016, a router failure grounded Southwest for four
days.1 A backup router failed to take over. Though the problem was fixed in twelve hours,
the failure wreaked havoc on Southwest’s operations for the next several days as the
airline struggled to get planes and crews where they were supposed to be. Over a three-day period,
Southwestcancelled2,300flights–about11%ofitsschedule.Thousandsofotherflightsweredelayed.
Next was Delta Air Lines. In August, 2016, a fire in Delta’s data center took down all of its computer
operations, causing it to cancel 2,100 flights over three days.2 Hundreds of other flights were delayed.

ThencameBritishAirways. InSeptember,2016, apower outage at its hubnear Heathrow airportcaused
a worldwide computer failure. Eleven flights were cancelled, and further BA flights throughout the day
experiencedtwo-hourdelays.
A United fault last summer lasted for two hours and disrupted travel for thousands of fliers. The outage
was caused by a malfunctioning router that prevented the carrier from ticketing passengers and
dispatchingcrews.
JetBlue experienced flight delays last January due to the loss of power at its data center. American
Airlines suffered from connectivity issues in September, 2015, and had to suspend flights at Miami,
ChicagoO’Hare,andDallas/FortWorthairports.

An Aging and Complex Infrastructure

The systems that many airlines depend upon were first developed decades ago when flights were fewer
and passenger options were simpler. For instance, Delta’s passenger check-in system is based on

Deltamatics, a legacy system put into service 52 years ago. The core design of these systems comes
from an era when the presumption was the systems would go down every night, creating a maintenance
windowduringwhichsystemscouldbeupgraded.
However, as airlines merged, new features were added to gain competitiveness (for instance, an extra
leg-room option in Economyclass). Thesefeatures were added to the original legacysystems, a process
made more difficult by the fact that the systems no longer could be brought down for upgrades. Airlines
today operate on a 24/7 basis, and their systems must do the same. As function upon function were
added to the original legacy systems, the systems became so complex that one small problem could
snowballeasilyintolargerones.
Consequently, complexity, not age, is the real problem. There are so many systems layered on top of
eachother.Examplesofsuchsystemsinclude:
 Reservations
 Passengercheck-in
 Aircraftassignment
 Flightcrewscheduling
 Airportgateassignment
 Airtrafficflowmanagement
Many of these systems have to interact with other systems such as mobile apps, loyalty awards, and the

Improvements are now multi-year and multi-million dollar investments. Every little piece has to work

Is Management to Blame?
What responsibility for these failures should management bear? In Delta’s case, the company invested
hundreds of millions of dollars in technology upgrades over the last three years to prevent exactly what
happened. This included bringing in two independent power sources into its Atlanta data center.
However, 300 of Delta’s 7,000 servers in the data center did not have dual power supplies, or if they did,
the independent power supplies were not plugged into opposite power sources. When one of the power
sources failed due to a fire, many of the servers were taken down along with their backups, taking down
theentireDeltasystem.

Companies with complex IT systems employ safeguards against failure with multiple layers of backup
components.Whensuchsystemsfail,itismuchmorethatasinglefailedcomponentorahumanmistake.

Management needs to have the transparency and accountability in the reporting chain to ensure
processes and management structures are in place and followed in order to prevent or mitigate against
these issues. Delta had invested in multiple power paths for its data center. It had everything in place to
sustain customer service. However, a lack of processes or enforcement of processes defeated the
investment.
The responsibility for cascading failure flows from the top down in an organization. Management can
contributetothesefailuresinmanyways:

 By encouraging an organizational culture that becomes dominated by a reactive mentality rather

 Throughbudgetcuttingthatreducespreventiveandproactivemaintenance.
IT organizations need to ensure that their people are adequately trained and resourced. They need to

Even Congress is getting involved. Democratic senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal have
sent a letter to thirteen airlines with ten questions regarding recent disruptions, the state of airlines’
technologysystems,andhowairlinesaccommodatepassengersduringoutages.
Summary
Delta’s control points are centralized. The airline runs route scheduling, ticketing, and check-in over a
single network. This approach is cost effective, but it runs smoothly only while the central control points
areavailable.Asinglefailurecantaketheentirenetworkdown.
As we’ve said manytimes in our articles, not onlymust you have geographicallyseparated redundancies
built into your systems (neither Delta not Southwest did), but failover to redundant components must be
periodicallytestedtoensurethattheywork.
Both Southwest and Delta had failover faults. Southwest’s backup router did not take over when the
primary router failed. Many of Delta’s servers could not fail over to their backups because they too lost
power.Clearly,neitherSouthwestnorDeltathoroughlytestedtheirfailovercapabilities.
