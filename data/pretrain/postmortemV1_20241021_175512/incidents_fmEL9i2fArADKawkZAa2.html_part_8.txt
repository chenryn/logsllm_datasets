Summary: Multiple Cloud products experiencing elevated error rates,
latencies or service unavailability in europe-west2

Description: A cooling related failure in one of our buildings that
hosts zone europe-west2-a for region europe-west2 is impacting multiple
Cloud services.

Cooling system restoration in europe-west2-a has been completed.

GCP product teams are working on restoring their services. ETA to be
determined.

We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.

**Product Impact:**

**Cloud Filestore:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: A small number of customers in europe-west2-a may
    be experiencing service unavailability. No new issues are expected
    for customers with working instances.
-   Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region, if
    possible.
-   Impact Mitigation: 07/20/22 09:18 US/Pacific

**MemoryStore for Redis:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will experience timeouts for management
    API (create, update, delete, etc.), and cache flushes.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**MemoryStore for Memcached**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Existing instances in europe-west2-a may be
    unavailable. Additionally, customers may experience degraded
    performance in europe-west2. Instance creation is not affected.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Cloud SQL:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: 4 zonal instances are still impacted. Most non-HA
    instances backed by europe-west2-a are working again in
    europe-west2-a. And most HA instances in europe-west2 are
    operational again as of 19:00 US/Pacific.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**GKE:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Certain portions of clusters with presence in
    europe-west2-a could be unavailable.
-   Workaround: Customers were encouraged to move their workloads to
    other regions if possible.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/20/22 07:57 US/Pacific

**Datastream:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Datastream Streams in that region might experience
    errors and lags which eventually could lead to lost position
-   Workaround: Customers were advised to run their Streams in another
    region.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/20/22 06:02 US/Pacific

**Bigtable:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Service unavailability and elevated latency for
    some customers in europe-west2.
-   Workaround: Workloads using replicated databases with replicas in
    europe-west2, may be moved to the region close to the other replicas
    to reduce latency.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/20/22 04:51 US/Pacific

**Cloud Dataproc:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Dataproc cluster creation and scale up could
    experience elevated error rate in europe-west2-a.
-   Workaround: Customers can choose a europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c or
    other regions.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/20/22 04:54 US/Pacific

**Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers were unable to perform any operations on
    Managed Active Directory (AD) domains which are single region
    (europe-west2). Customers could also experience a degraded
    experience if one domain controller is unavailable due to zonal
    impact.
-   Workaround: None at this time.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 22:15 US/Pacific

**Cloud Data Fusion:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis : Service unavailability in europe-west2 for a very
    few customers.
-   Workaround: None at this time.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 21:30 US/Pacific

**Google Cloud Storage:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers with data in the impacted region could
    see elevated errors when attempting to read objects.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 08:53 US/Pacific

**Google BigQuery:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Datasets were unavailable for the impacted
    locations.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 13:43 US/Pacific

**Google App Engine and Cloud Functions:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers could experience high error rates for
    Google App Engine and Cloud Functions in europe-west2 for requests
    coming through Cloud Pubsub, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and Cloud
    Scheduler. Pubsub, Eventarc, and Cloud Tasks traffic will be
    automatically retried once the outage is resolved. Cloud Scheduler
    requests will need to be resubmitted.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 11:05 US/Pacific

**Dataflow:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Dataflow Streaming jobs already running in the
    impacted area might have been stuck. New Dataflow jobs could not
    start.
