HP’s OpenCall INS Goes Active/Active
June2007
A major telecommunications company is now providing an extended version of HP’s OpenCall
INS cell phone application to cell-phone service providers. Running on NonStop servers in an
active/active configuration, this product is highly scalable. Furthermore, this configuration can
survivemultiplenodefailuresandwillvirtuallyneverbeoutofservice.
OpenCall INS
HP’s OpenCall is a broad portfolio of software products that supports all levels of telephony
network infrastructure. Within this portfolio, the OpenCall Intelligent Network Server (INS)
supports wireline, wireless, and the new IP Multimedia Subsystem-based networks (IMS).
RunningonHP’sNonStopservers,OpenCallINSishighlyreliableandhighlyscalable.
OpenCall INS provides key telecom functionality required by cell-phone service providers via
packagesdevelopedbyHPanditspartners.Thesefunctionsinclude:
 genericnumbertranslationofabbreviatednumbersintocompletefinaladdresses.
 settingupglobalvirtualprivatenetworksandwirelessprivatebranchexchanges(PBX).
 Home Location Registers (HLR) for managing wireless networks and subscriber
privileges.1
 providing integrated subscriber data storage and management for instant group
communicationservicesinIMSnetworks.
 Controlling and managing the resources required to calculate a mobile terminal’s
position.
 real-time rating and management for service providers offering advanced voice/data
productcatalogs.
 real-timebillingforprepaidorpost-paidsubscriptions.
 deliveringmissedcallinformationtosubscribersviaSMS(ShortMessageService).
 wireless caller identification for providing the called party with the calling party’s name

OpenCall INS in an Active/Active Environment
The active/active version of OpenCall INS runs on a multinode NonStop system.Each node runs
the entire gamut of applications, and a request or update can be directed to any node in the
applicationnetwork.

Shouldanynodefail,itis simplyremoved from thenetwork.Thetransaction load is thenhandled
bythesurvivingnodesinthenetwork.
The system is configured so that there is the number of nodes required to handle the transaction
load plus at least one additional node to allow for a node failure. By distributing the nodes
geographically, disaster tolerance is achieved. Should a node be taken down by a disaster of
some sort, all further transactions are simply routed to the surviving nodes. The product vendor
callsthisconfigurationits“N+1GeographicRedundancyConfiguration.”

The databases of all of the nodes are kept in synchronization via Shadowbase bidirectional
replicationfromGravic,Inc.(www.gravic.com).
The original OpenCall INS applications were not able to run in an active/active environment,
except in partitioned manner in which each node “owned” a portion of the database. All updates
to a partition had to be directed to the “owning” node. Shadowbase extends this capability by
allowing any node to process any transaction against any partition of the database in a true
active/activemanner.
Data Collision Detection and Resolution
In the applications running on each node, data collisions can occur. To resolve them, one of the
nodes intheapplicationnetwork is designatedtheMaster node.Theothers are designatedSlave

nodes. This is an example of an active/active hierarchical configuration (as opposed to those
configurationsinwhichallnodesareequalpeers).
Whenachangeis madetothedatabasebyaSlavenode,rather thanreplicatingit toallnodes in
the network, the Slave simply replicates the change to the Master node. The Master node will
updateitsdatabaseandwillthenreplicatethatchangetoalloftheSlavenodes.
Shouldtwonodes(eithertwoSlavesoraSlaveandtheMaster)attempttochangethesamedata
item at the same time within the replication latency time so that neither is aware of the other’s
change, a data collision has occurred. The Master will receive these conflicting updates and will
resolve the collision based upon its business rules.2 In this case, the first change to update the
Masterwins.

After updating its database with the chosen update, the Master will replicate that change to the
Slave nodes. In this way, all databases are kept in an identical state (within the replication
latency).Rejectedchangesareloggedforlaterreview.

Thus, data collisions are resolved by the Master node, which is the final adjudicator. The
databases of all of the Slave nodes will converge to the contents of the Master database.
Therefore,thedatabaseattheMasternodemaybeconsideredtobethe“databaseofrecord.”
Zero Downtime Migrations
Equallyimportant to extremeavailabilityis the needto eliminateplanned downtime.Among other
reasons, planned downtime is needed to move to new application versions, to upgrade the
operatingsystem,torestructurethedatabase,ortomodifythenodalhardwareconfigurations.
In an active/active configuration such as this, any node in the system can be upgraded without
taking down the system.This is done simplybytaking that node out of service. While the node is
out of service, all processing activity is handled by the other nodes. The downed node is then
upgraded,tested,andreturnedtoservicebylettingtheMasternodeknowthatitisnowavailable.

Rolling Upgrades
The Master will resynchronize the downed database by letting the replication queue that had
been building in the Master drain to the restored node’s database. This procedure updates that
databasewithallofthechangesthathadoccurredwhileitwasdown.

to match the master’s database, then the replication facility provides the tools to re-load the
upgradednode’sdatabasewiththefullimageofthemaster’sdatabase.
The upgrade can then be rolled through the system by taking down each node one at a time,
upgrading it, returning it to service, and moving on to the next node. When the Master node is to
upgraded, one of the Slave nodes is promoted to be the Master before taking the Master out of
service.
Once the Master is upgraded and returned to service, it can either be restored to its Master
status,oritcancontinueinserviceasaSlavenode.
Capacity Expansion
System capacity can be easily modified by adding or removing Slave nodes. When a node is
addedorremoved,theMasternodeisnotifiedofthenewconfiguration.
System Availability
From an availability viewpoint, any number of Slave nodes mayfail; and the system will continue
tobe operational within the capacitycapabilities of the remaining nodes.Should a Master system
fail, one of the Slave nodes is promoted to be the new Master; and the system continues in
operation.
If the system is configured with two or more spare Slave nodes, the system availability becomes
so high as to render meaningless any sort of availability calculation. For instance, a ten-node
NonStop system with two spares will have a calculated availability of over ten 9s, which is an
average of 3 milliseconds of downtime per year. However, this availability can never be verified
andisboundtobeswampedbyotherfactors.
