The Looming Threat of a Solar Superstorm

thatitmightbeweeksbeforepowerwasrestored.
Fortunately, unlike many of our neighbors, we had an electric generator and survived quite nicely for a
couple of days. I had purchased a generator (5,500 watts) powerful enough to power all of the critical
elementsinthehouse–furnace,waterpump,refrigeratorsandfreezers,microwave,andseverallights.
However, we began to run low on gasoline for the generator and set out with what fuel we had in the car
to obtain more gasoline. To our disappointment, we found that there were no gas stations at which we
couldfillup.Eithertheyhadnopower;oriftheyhadagenerator,theyhadrunoutoffuel.
Wewere lucky. Our power was restored in another day. However, neighboring areas were without power
forweeks.
It drove home to me the consequences of a long power outage. What if we had been without power for
months?Couldsuchacalamityhappen?Theanswerisyes,andtheculpritisasolarsuperstorm.

prepared!
What Is a Solar Storm?
A solar storm is a mass of electrons, ions, and atoms burst into space by a solar flare. A solar flare is a
sudden flash of brightness observed near the Sun’s surface. Solar flares are numerous. They occur
anywherefromseveralperdaytoonceperweek,dependingupontheSun’s11-yearsolarcycle.

Themagnetized plasmaof asolar storm shock wave travels at millions of miles per hour.Sucha burst of
electromagnetic activity is called a “coronal mass ejection,” or CME. If a CME hits the Earth, it can cause
massoutagesofpowergridsandcommunications.
The solar flares that cause CMEs originate with sunspots. A sunspot is a darkened area of reduced
surface temperature on the Sun. The number of sunspots varies with the 11-year solar cycle. Sunspots
can last from days to months. Their size typically ranges from ten miles to 100,000 miles, and they may
travelacrossthesunatarateofhundredsofmilesanhour.
Once sunspots erupt, an initial wave of radiation strikes Earth within minutes. This radiation travels at the
speed of light. Since the CME comprises particles, it moves much more slowly (albeit at millions of miles
anhour)andtakesadayortwotoreachEarth.
We have warnings of incoming CMEs.We have satellites positioned between the Sun and the Earth that

ACMEdistortstheEarth’s magneticfield.Justlikeamovingmagnetwillinduceacurrentinacoilofwire,
the movement of the Earth’s magnetic field caused by a CME induces a current in the soil of the earth.
This current can enter high-voltage transformers that are grounded to protect them from lightning strikes.
The currents from a strong solar storm are intense enough to destroy the transformers. It is this action
thatallowsastrongsolarstormtotakedownourpowergrids.
In addition, the electromagnetic interference of a solar storm can interrupt radio communications, disable
GPS,andcausesatellitestospinoutofcontrol.
Quebec Plunged Into Darkness
On March 13, 1989, a solar storm disrupted electric power throughout most of the Canadian province of
Quebec.Rushingtoward Earthat amillionmiles anhour,thegeomagnetic disturbance of thesolar storm

The electrical currents found a weakness in the electrical power grid of Quebec. Within minutes, the
entire province of Quebec lost power. It took twelve hours to restore power to the Quebec residents and
businesses.

The Carrington Event
The strongest solar storm ever recorded occurred in 1859. An incredible surge of charged particles sent
by the sun slammed into Earth’s atmosphere and caused havoc on the ground. Large currents were
induced into telegraph wires (the Internet of its time). Telegraphs sent out sparks that ignited several wild
fires.NorthernlightswerereportedasfarsouthasCuba.
The1859storm iscalledthe“CarringtonEvent” after theBritishamateur astronomer,RichardCarrington,
who observed the solar flare and associated it with the effects of the solar storm that occurred two days
later. He was the first to realize the link between activity on the sun and geomagnetic disturbances on
Earth.
What Impact Would a Carrington Event Have Today?
In 1859, the peak of technology was the telegraph. There were no power grids, no radio transmitters, no
GPS.Todayisadifferentstory.

If a Carrington Event should occur today, there is a mass of technology that would be affected. GPS
systems would be taken down. Mobile phones would be useless. There would be no way for first
responders to communicate with each other. Satellite communications would be at risk. So much of our
daily life is governed by communications. How could we use credit cards if there were no satellite
communications? There would be no capability for wire transfers or automated clearing-house
transactions. There would be no online banking. Maybe there would be no “online.” We would become a
cashandbartersociety.
However,thebigfearistheelectricgrid.PowersurgescausedbyCMEscanblow outgianttransformers.
These transformers can take months or even years to replace.1 Major cities could be without power for
weeksormonths,orperhapsforoverayear.
A 2013 report published by Lloyd’s insurance company estimates that a Carrington Event would result in
power outages affecting twenty to forty million Americans for a duration lasting from two weeks to two
years.
How would we survive? We depend on power for so many of our essential needs. Without power,
perishable foods and medicines would spoil. Fuel and water relying on electrical pumps would become
inaccessible. We would have no communications. The twin specters of social collapse and mass
starvationwouldstalkentirecontinents.BacktotheDarkAges.
However, we do have warning of the approach of a CME. In a pinch, power companies could elect to
protect their electric grids by taking them offline before the storm strikes. Solar storms tend to pass in a
couple of hours. Being without electricity for a few hours is certainly preferable to being without it for
weeks.
Unfortunately, current forecasting of solar storms is still in its early days. Space-weather predictions are
where weather forecasting was sixty or seventy years ago. There would certainly be many false alarms,
whichwouldcauseanequalnumberofunnecessarypoweroutages.
A Carrington Event aside, even smaller solar storms can wreak havoc. The “Halloween Storm” of 2003
disrupted communications, caused a power outage in Sweden, and created auroras as far south as
FloridaandTexas.
What Is the U.S. Doing To Protect Itself?
Notmuch!
A2011DepartmentofHomelandSecurityreportstated:
“The U.S. government lacks comprehensive, national-level geomagnetic storm risk management
assessments and strategies for a large-scaled storm that could knock out power along the entire
Easternseaboard”
Several bills have been put before the U.S. Congress, and all have failed. There is currently another
bipartisan bill being introduced. It would authorize replacement of solar-monitoring satellites that are
nearingend-of-life,anditwouldprovidefundsforfurtherresearch.
