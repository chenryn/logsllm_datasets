November2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

Linux exploit gives anyuserfull access in five seconds
If you need another reason to beparanoidabout network security, a serious exploit that attacks a
nine-year-old Linux kernel flaw is now in the wild. The researcher who found it, Phil Oester,
toldV3thattheattackis"trivialtoexecute,neverfailsandhasprobablybeenaroundforyears."

Theinternetapocalypsemaphidesthemajorvulnerabilitythatcreatedit
During the massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on DNS service provider Dyn, one
might be forgiven for mistaking the maps of network outages for images of some post-apocalyptic
nuclear fallout. Screenshots from sites likedowndetector.comshowed menacingly red, fuzzy heat
maps of, well, effectively just population centers of the United States experiencing serious difficulty
accessing Twitter, Github, Etsy, or any of Dyn's other high-profile clients. Aside from offering little
detail and making a DDoS literally into a glowing red menace, they also obscured the reality of just
how centralized a lot of internet infrastructure reallyis. DNS is ground zero forthe uneasy tension of
theinternet’spresumeddecentralizedresilience.

Whendisasterstrikes:Usethecloud-it'snot2009
One thing that hasn't changed since 2009 is that the number one cause of a data failure in a
business is still human error. If you have a backup system in place that relies on humans
remembering to take a tape out each morning, label it, put it in a box, hand that box to another
human who takes it somewhere (hopefully safe) and then repeat again every morning, then you are
asking for trouble. Most companies don't even do it daily - usually it's only once a week when those
tapesaresentoffsite.

Just a reminder how a whale fail (not fail whale) may have impacted the 2012 U.S. Presidential
election
The Romney campaign looked forward with confidence to the November 6, 2012, U.S. presidential
election. Not only were many polls improving in its favor, but it had a secret weapon that it did not
disclose until just before Election Day. Orca! Orca was a massive, technologically sophisticated tool
that was aimed at GOTV – Get Out The Vote – in the critical swing states that would decide the
election outcome. In elections that are as close as this one was predicted to be, outperforming polls
by a single point can mean that entire states and all their Electoral votes can be won. But Orca
failed. It never got off the ground on ElectionDay. Wasthisoutage the cause of GovernorRomney’s
losstoPresidentObama?

ExoMarssetforMarsrendezvousaftercommunicationsfailure
TheExoMars 2016mission is set for its rendezvous with the Red Planet on October 19. On Sunday
at 4:42 pm CEST (14:42 GMT), the Schiaparelli module successfully separated from the Trace Gas
Orbiter (TGO), and Monday morning at 4:42 am CEST (02:42 GMT) the orbiter executed a crucial
course correction after a heart-stopping glitch that caused the spacecraft to lose communications
with Earth. Despite this, ESA says both the TGO and Schiaparelli are currently healthy and on
course. Note: after the publication of this article, the Schiaparelli module deployed its parachute
prematurelyandcrashed.

Level 3Communicationshascited a "configurationerror" as the root cause of itsnationwide network
outage on Tuesday, October 4th. According to the company, "Investigations revealed that an
improper entry was made to a call routing table during provisioning work being performed on the
Level 3 network. This was the configuration change that led to the outage. The entry did not specify
a telephone number to limit the configuration change to, resulting in non-subscriber country code +1
calls to be released while the entry remained present.The configuration adjustments deleted this
