The Uptime Institute
October2015
The Uptime Institute is a consortium of companies that engages in education,
publication, consulting, certifications, conferences, and seminars for the enterprise data-
center industry and for data-center professionals. Founded in 1993, it is headquartered in New York City
and has offices inSanFrancisco,Washington,D.C., Boston,Seattle, Denver, London, São Paulo,Dubai,
andSingapore.
TheInstituteoffers widelyadoptedTier certificationfor data centers viathecreationandadministrationof
its Tier standards, “Tier Standards & Certification for Data Center Design, Construction, and Operational
Sustainability.” The standards fall into two categories – data-center topology and data-center operational
sustainability.
Data Center Site Infrastructure Tier Standard: Topology
The Tier Standard for Topology is detailed in the Uptime Institute’s document entitled ”Data Center Site
Infrastructure Tier Standard: Topology.” This standard forms the basis for comparing the functionality,
capacity, and expected availability of a particular site infrastructure. It defines four classifications (Tiers I
through IV, with Tier IV being the highest rating) based on increasing levels of redundant capacity
componentsanddistributedpaths.
The Tier topology rating for an entire site is constrained by the rating of the weakest subsystem that will
impact site operations. For example, a site with a robust Tier IV UPS configuration and a Tier II chilled-
watersystem yieldsaTierIIrating.
TheTiersaredefinedasfollows:
TierI:BasicSiteInfrastructure
A Tier I basic data center has non-redundant capacity components and a single non-redundant
distributionpathservingthecriticalenvironment.

TierII:RedundantSiteInfrastructureCapacityComponents
A Tier II data center has redundant capacity components and a single, non-redundant distribution path
servingthecriticalenvironment.
The redundant components include generators, UPS modules and energy storage devices, chillers, heat
rejectionequipment,pumps,coolingunits,andfueltanks.

TierIII:ConcurrentlyMaintainableSiteInfrastructure
A Tier III data center has redundant capacity components and multiple independent distribution paths
serving the critical environment. Only one distribution path is required to serve the critical environment at
anyonetime(i.e.,anactive/backupconfiguration).
AllITequipmentisdual-powered.
Every component can be removed from service on a planned basis without impacting any of the critical
environment. There is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the site when redundant components are
removedfromservice.
TierIV:FaultTolerantSiteInfrastructure
A Tier IV data center has multiple, independent, physically isolated systems that provide redundant
capacity components and multiple, independent, diverse, active distribution paths simultaneously serving
thecriticalenvironment(i.e.,anactive/activeconfiguration).
AllITequipmentisdual-powered.
A single failure of any component will not impact the critical environment. Every component can be
removed from service on a planned basis without impacting any of the critical environment. There is
sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the site when redundant components are removed from service

Data Center Site Infrastructure Tier Standard: Operational Sustainability
The business mission of any data center is to meet the availability and performance objectives of the
organization while delivering satisfactory Return on Investment (ROI). The biggest barrier to achieving
thismissionisnotthefacilityinfrastructure.Itishumanerror.
The Uptime Institute’s Abnormal Incident Reports database reveals that the leading cause of reported
data-center outages are directly attributable to shortfalls in management, staff activities, and operations
procedures. However, all the blame does not lie with frontline operating teams. Upstream management
decisions can either support reliability and efficiency, or they can set a data center on a path towards
failure.
TheTier Standard for Operational Sustainabilityis asetof data-center facilitymanagementpractices that
help support the business objectives, independent of site infrastructure. Its focus is not on the design
topologyor infrastructureconfigurationbutinsteadontheday-to-daydecisions,practices,documentation,
andteameffectiveness.

Summary
The uptime of a data center is the resultant combination of both the Tier of the site infrastructure and the
levelofOperationalSustainability.
The Uptime Institute provides two credentials that validate a data center’s management and operations
bestpractices:
 Tier Certification of Operational Sustainability (TCOS) for organizations that are on a Tier
CertificationTrack.
