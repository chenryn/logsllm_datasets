Cellular Provider Goes Active/Active for Prepaid Calls
September2008
The Pan-African Cellular Service Provider
One of the largest cellular telephone service providers in Africa holds more than 50% of the cell-
phone market share in its country. It manages a cell network made up of thousands of cell sites,
whichprovidecoveragetoover95%oftheSouthAfricanpopulation.Itisatestamenttothegreat
open space in South Africa that this coverage only needs to extend to 6% of South Africa’s total
geographicalarea.
The company also provides cell service to several other African countries, including Tanzania,
Mozambique,Lesotho,andtheDemocraticRepublicoftheCongo.
Intotal,over20millioncustomersinthesecountriesareservicedbythisprovider.
The prepaid calling card market is the fastest growing cellular service segment in Africa. From a
processing viewpoint, prepaid cards generate about 1.5 to 2 million updates per hour against a
six-terabyte database. To handle this volume, the company uses in its production environment

The Prepaid Calling Card
Prepaid calling cards are purchased by subscribers at stores throughout the company’s service
area. Each card carries a unique identification number (PIN) and entitles the purchaser to a
specified amount of additional money on his call account. A subscriber activates his additional
money by calling the company’s prepaid calling card service and entering the card identification
number.
A subscriber can also recharge his time without having to purchase a prepaid calling card by

Subscribers’ call accounts are kept on Intelligent Network (IN) platforms.These platforms are not
supplied by HP, so communication with these platforms is over TCP/IP using a proprietary
messagelayout.

The Prepaid Recharge System
Prepaid calling cards are generallycalled vouchers since they represent a monetary value rather
than call time. The IN platforms deduct the cost of a call from the subscriber’s call account. The
prepaid calling card service is provided by the company’s Prepaid Recharge System, which
manages money recharges by the company’s subscribers. This system provides facilities for
subscribers to add money to their call accounts by entering a prepaid voucher PIN. Typically,
users will redeem vouchers via their cell phones. However, recharge facilities are also available
via bank ATMs or at point-of-sale (POS) terminals in the bigger supermarket chains. Web
servicesalsoallowthesubscribertopurchaseSMSordatabundlesoutofhiscallaccount.Using
the web services, subscribers can also view their remaining credit and transfer money from one
cell-phonenumbertoanother.
When a user first turns on his cell phone, the cell phone logs him into the network via the closest
cell-phone tower. Each user is assigned an IN Home Location Register (HLR),1 which is an
active/active NonStop system that tracks the current location of the user and his account profile.
The user’s HLR is determined from the first six digits of his cell-phone number. Upon logon, IN

When a user dials a number, IN will establish a connection between him and his called party.

The Active/Active Heart
The heart of this system is the Prepaid Front End, or PPFE. It is the PPFE that interacts with the

PrepaidFrontEnd (PPFE)
Therefore, the PPFE must be up virtually 100% of the time. If it should go down, subscribers
cannot recharge; and cell-phone service will be denied to a large segment of cell-phone
subscribers.
To ensure extreme availabilityfor prepaid card service, the company has implemented the PPFE
as a pair of NonStop nodes in an active/active architecture. One node is located in Pretoria,
SouthAfrica,andtheotherislocatedinMidrand,SouthAfrica.
Thetwonodescarryidenticaldatabases.Thedatabasesarekeptinsynchronismviabidirectional
asynchronous replication provided by Gravic, Inc.’s Shadowbase replication engine
(www.gravic.com). The primary information that is replicated is that contained in the Recharge
Logs.
Should a node fail, all call transactions are routed to the surviving node, which continues to
provide prepaid card services for all subscribers in the company’s network.When the failed node
is returned to service, its database is resynchronized with the active node; and normal replicated
serviceisreturned.
The service provider did not initially use the system in a true active/active configuration, in which
both nodes are actively processing transactions, because of concerns of fraudulent activity. For
instance, two subscribers could use the same voucher simultaneously; and if their requests were
routed to different nodes, they could succeed. In a single-node setup, the voucher record is
lockedbythefirstattempt;andthesecondattemptisblocked.
Therefore, the company used the PPFE active/active system in a “sizzling hot” standby
configuration. All transactions were handled by one node, the primary node, and were replicated
to the other node, the backup node. The backup node had all applications running and the
databaseopenedsothatitcouldtakeoverinstantlyintheeventofthefailureoftheprimarynode.

However, the company has since resolved this concern and is now in the process of cutting over
to a true active/active operation. To avoid fraudulent use and data collisions, one system will
handleodd-numberedvouchers;andtheotherwillhandleeven-numberedvouchers2.
Ancillary Systems
The PPFE feeds several ancillary systems important to the provision of prepaid card services.
These systems are run as monolithic systems since their availability is not so critical. Though
there is no need to synchronize the PPFE database with the ancillary systems, Shadowbase is
used to transfer information between these systems by replicating database transactions from
onesystemtoanother.

WebAccess
Subscriber web access to prepaid card data is provided by a web server running on a
Windows/SQL Server platform. By using his browser, a subscriber can view the available money
left in his account. He can add money to a card and can transfer moneyfrom one cell number to
another.UpdatessuchasthesearereplicatedbacktothePPFEdatabase.
Bidirectional replication is used by the web server to access data from the PPFE to support a

2 Avoiding collisions by routing specific cards to specific nodes can be easily extended to more than two nodes by
assigningmore of the digits in the card number to the routing table. For instance, the entire last digit can be used to

StockCardReporting
The Stock Card Reporting System tracks the prepaid vouchers that have been sent to stores for
subscriber purchase. It tracks all cards that have been printed since 1996, even those that have
been used or that have expired. Currently, there are over two billion cards in the Stock Card
Reportingdatabase,ofwhich50millionormoreareactiveatanyonetime.

The Result
By implementing the critical Prepaid Front End as an active/active system, the company has
ensured continuous subscriber account recharging, calling time transfer, and calling time query
servicestoitssubscribers.

PPFE. NonStop servers are judiciously used for those ancillary systems requiring greater
availability.
The cellular provider’s Prepaid Recharge System is an excellent example of a heterogeneous
system mixing active/active technologies with high-availability systems, all connected by a
