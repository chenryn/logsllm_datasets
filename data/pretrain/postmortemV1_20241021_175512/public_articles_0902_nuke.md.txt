1961 – North Carolina Nuked (Almost)
February2014
January 24, 1961: Two nuclear bombs break loose from a crippled B-52 bomber and fall on
North Carolina. Three out of four safety mechanisms on one bomb engaged. Only one safety

The U.S. Air Force’s Cold War Strategy
DuringtheColdWarwiththeSovietUnion,theUnitedStatescreatedageneralplanfornuclear war.This
plan was called the Single Integrated Operational Plan and was one of the most secret issues in U.S.
national security policy. SIOP integrated the capabilities of heavy bombers, land-based intercontinental
missiles, and sea-based submarine-launched ballistic missiles to strike targets if they launched a nuclear
attackagainsttheU.S.
Under SIOP, one-third of the Strategic Air Command’s (SAC) nuclear bombers had to be airborne and
armedwithnuclearbombsatalltimes.Inthisway,theywouldnotbecaughtonthegroundintheeventof
an attack and could proceed directly to Russia, China, or any of the Soviet-aligned states that had
launchedanattack.
The Doomed B-52 SAC Bomber
The B-52 Stratofortress bomber has been a mainstay of the U.S. Air
Forcesince1955.Itisexpectedtocontinueinserviceintothe2040s.
It is a subsonic swept wing bomber powered by eight turbojet
engineshousedinfourenginepods.
OnJanuary23,1961,aB-52armedwithtwoMark 39nuclearbombs
took off from Seymour Johnson Air Base in Goldsboro, North
Carolina, U.S.A., near the Eastern Seaboard. The aircraft was on a
24-hour alert mission under the SIOP plan. The Mark 39 nuclear
bomb is a two-megaton bomb with over 100 times the power of the
Hiroshimaatomicbomb.
Around midnight, the B-52 rendezvoused with a tanker for mid-air fueling. The B-52 is a wet-wing aircraft
in which the fuel tank is, in fact, the wing. During the refueling, the tanker crew advised the B-52 captain
that he had a leak in his right wing and that he was losing fuel. The fueling was aborted, and ground
controlwasnotified.

and the fuel on board the B-52 exceed that limit). However, when the aircraft reached its assigned
position, the captain reported that the situation had worsened. He had lost 37.000 pounds of fuel in just
threeminutes.TheaircraftwasimmediatelydirectedtoreturntotheSeymourJohnsonAirBaseandland.
As the aircraft descended through 10,000 feet, it began to break up. The captain ordered the crew to
eject. Five landed safely, but one crew member who ejected did not survive. Two crew members died in
the crash. The wreckage covered two-square miles of tobacco and cotton farmland in Faro, North
Carolina,abouttwelvemilesnorthofGoldsboro.
Bombs Away
As the B-52 tore apart in its uncontrolled descent, the two nuclear bombs
broke free. Lanyards connected to each bomb were jerked and began the
armingprocess.
One bomb behaved as designed. It continued its arming process. Two
additional arming steps were activated. The first step deployed a parachute
to drop the bomb. The bomb is designed to explode at altitude to cause the
most wide-spread damage. In the second step, the firing capacitors were
charged. These detonate ordinary explosives to force two nuclear masses
togethertocreateacriticalmassthatwillcauseanuclearreaction.
However, the bomb did not explode. Its parachute tangled in a tree and it
was hanging upright and undamaged when found. A fourth and last arming
step did not take place. A safe/arm switch was found to be still in the safe
position. Three of four safety precautions failed. It was only the fourth that

The parachute for the second bomb did not deploy. The bomb became
only partially armed from the lanyard. It fell at 700 miles per hour into a
field, disintegrated, and buried itself 180 feet down in mud. Its safe/arm
switch was thrown off in the impact and found nearby. To great
consternation,itwasfoundtobeinthearmedposition.
The buried bomb could not be recovered because of ground water. Its

The Aftermath
The two-megaton Mark 39 nuclear bomb had a 100% kill radius of 17 miles. Radioactive fallout from the
blast would have spread over the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S., hitting Washington, D.C., Baltimore,
Philadelphia,andNewYork.
The wet-wing design of the B-52 was found to be experiencing 60% more stress during flight than older
modelsofthebomber.ThissituationwasrectifiedbyBoeingin1964byredesigningtheB-52’swing.
Summary
Many of the world’s nuclear powers still have hundreds and thousands of nuclear weapons. The U.S.

notes that from 1950 to 1968, there were 700 significant accidents and incidents involving 1,250 nuclear
weapons.Noneofthesewerepubliclydisclosed.
Problems continue to exist. On January 15, 2014, the U.S. Air Force suspended
34 missile-launch officers stationed at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana
andrevokedtheirsecurityclearances.Theywerefoundtohavebeencheatingon
monthly exams to ensure that they were capable of managing the nuclear
warheads on top of their Minuteman III intercontinental missiles buried in silos at
thebase.
Eleven officers, including two from the above group, were found guilty of drug
use.
We clearly are at risk from a cataclysmic nuclear incident until the world frees
itselfofnuclearweapons.
