Hacked AP Tweet Crashes Markets
May2013
On Tuesday, April 23, 2013, an Associated Press (AP) tweet reported that President Obama had been
injured in an explosion at the White House. It sent the U.S. financial markets into an instant tailspin.
Fortunately, the tweet was false. The AP Twitter account had been hacked. However, what does this
mean for “flash crashes” in the future when unverified and perhaps malicious information is disseminated
viasocialmedia?
The False Tweet
A little after 1 PM EST on April 23rd, the AP twitter feed @AP reported “Breaking: Two Explosions in the
White House and Barak Obama is injured.” The stock markets reacted instantly. Between 1:08 and 1:10
PM, the Dow Jones Average dropped 143 points. The S&P lost 1%. Almost $2 billion in the market value
ofsecuritiesevaporated.
Within minutes, AP issued a retraction via another Twitter account saying “The @AP Twitter account has
been suspended after it was hacked. The tweet about an attack on the White House was false.” The AP
also used its Web site and blogs to inform its followers about the hacking. However, the tweet had

the panic orders that were placed as a result of the false tweet were never executed. The drop in the
marketcouldhavebeenmuchworse.
It was not only the equities markets that suffered. All of the U.S. financial markets fell, including bond
marketsandcommoditymarkets.
AnorganizationcallingitselftheSyrianElectronicArmy,asupporterofSyrianPresidentBasharal-Assad,
claimed responsibility for the hacked tweet. The FBI and securities regulators such as the Commodities
FuturesTradingCommission(CFTC)areinvestigating,alongwithAPandTwitter.
People or Computers?
How could major markets react so swiftly to such bad news? Were thousands of traders hovering over
theirtradingterminalswatchingnewsreportsandreadytohitthesellkey?
Not likely. The AP launched an instant investigation and noted that only computers could react this
quickly.High-speed trading has becomethenorm inthemarkets.Powerfulcomputers located nexttothe
exchanges to minimize network latency place thousands of orders each second, most of which are not
executed, in an attempt to gauge the market and make rapid trades worth pennies. In 2012, 50% of all
tradeswereexecutedviahigh-frequencytrading.
These computers use highly sophisticated algorithms to maximize trading profits. Some of these
algorithms follow news stories and other social media such as Twitter looking for buzzwords. They react
instantlytogoodorbadnews.Inthiscase,theyreactedwithgreatalarmtosomeseriousbadnews.They

How Did @AP Get Hacked?

On the day in question, the hacking was preceded by a “phishing attempt” when journalists received an
impressively disguised email encouraging them to divulge their names and passwords. Perhaps at least

Can News Sources Be Trusted?
Themediatakes greatcare tobe atrustedsourceof information.Stories are checkedandverified before
release.Wheneverthereisamisreporting,thenewsagencysuffersaseriousblackeye.
The AP is one of the most trusted of news sources. Founded in 1846, the AP is a not-for-profit news
organization funded by its newspaper and broadcast members. It has 2,000 journalists worldwide. It is
especially sensitive to misinformation since it is a resource for most major newspapers and broadcast
networksintheworld.
However, the AP is not the only news organization facing this problem. During the previous weekend,
CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ and ’48 Hours’ were also hacked. Some of its Twitter accounts were posting malicious
links.Onehackedtweetfrom ’60Minutes’ read,“Terror is strikingthe #USA and#Obamais Shamelessly
inBedwithal-Qaeda.”

What Can Be Done to Prevent This?
Twitter has had a history of experience with this sort of problem. In February, it had to reset 250,000
passwordsthatitfearedhadbeencompromised.
Twitter is now working on an optional two-factor authentication procedure. Any time someone who has
chosen this option logs onto Twitter via a new device with his user name and password, he must also
enter a random security code that is sent to his cell phone in real time. Google and Facebook already
offersuchanauthenticationprocedure.
Summary
In April, 2013, the SEC began to allow companies to disclose market-sensitive information via Facebook
and Twitter so long as their investors have been told in advance where to look. This potentially exposes
us to more of the same problem. Imagine a hacked tweet going out about a company’s earnings report
just before its report is formally presented indicating that it has missed its projections by a wide margin.
The company’sstockislikelytocrash.
Tweets like this could be used by a malicious party to short a stock just before the tweet is released so
that the short could be covered at the dip. Alternatively, the malicious partycould buythe stock at the dip

This was a classic flash crash. If you combine the flood of instant information – often unverified – on
social media with automated trading programs that buy and sell based on that information in
microseconds,yougetthepotentialforabigmessliketheflashcrashcausedbythe@APtweet.Wecan
expect further such crashes in the future. It’s not the fact that social media is subject to hacking. It is that

In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, the most comprehensive regulatory reform measures
taken since the Great Depression. Nowhere does that act mention high-speed trading or technology.
