However, this time, cash from the bank’s ATMs was plentiful – too plentiful for some. The technical
problem forced Commonwealth to disconnect the transaction switch connecting some of its core systems
to its ATMs. Its ATMs could still dispense cash, logging the transactions locally in the ATM. Since there
was nocheck of acustomer’s accountbalance,customersfoundthattheycould withdrawanyamountby
simply visiting several of the bank’s ATMs. Word of this bonanza quickly spread, and there were reports

Singapore
Singapore’s largest banking network, comprising the DBS and POSB banks, lost most of its IT functions
in July, 2010.3 Gone were its online banking, its ATMs, its payment-card services, and its back-office
systems.
The problem was caused by an IBM employee who directed operations staff to use an outdated
procedure to perform maintenance on a disk-storage system. The correct procedure had yet to be
documented.IBMtookfullblamefortheoutage.

two systems involved in these exchanges. One is the banking IT infrastructure, which has proven to be
anything but reliable. The other is the financial-transaction switches that interconnect the ATMs and POS
terminalswiththebanks.
If one of these switches should go down, it would affect many banks. These switches have proven to
highly reliable. They rely on modern technology and generally are fully redundant. They are provided by
such products as ACI’s BASE24-eps, Opsol’s OmniPayments, AJB’s RTS. ElectraCard Services’

What Is Going On?
Banks aresaddled withdecades-old legacysystemsdesignedfor batchprocessing.Theyarereluctantto
replace complex systems built in the 1960s and 1970s that have been working fine for years. These
systems are difficult to maintain since the developers have long since retired or died. Furthermore, they
tend to be written in COBOL and PL1, and qualified programmers in these languages are becoming few
andfarbetween.
Compounding this challenge is that today’s systems tend to be a patchwork of dated systems cobbled
togetherasaresultofmergersandacquisitionsoverrecentyears.
However, the banks have to meet the growing demand for customer-facing applications such as online
banking and mobile services. They are building new systems to handle these tasks and are interfacing
them to their legacy systems with middleware. Consequently, the systems are becoming more and more
complex.Atthesametime,theyarecuttingITstaffandareoutsourcingmoreandmoreoftheirITsupport
overseas.
Jean-LouisBravard,formerCIOofJ.P.MorganChasehasdescribedthesituationasfollows:
”Retail banks relyon obsolete legacyIT surrounded byanever-increasingplethoraof newer systems
to give consumers the impression that the banking systems are fit for purpose in our internet and
smartphoneworld.”
The CEO of RBS admits that for years, RBS had made little investment in their IT systems, preferring
instead to struggle with their aging infrastructure. RBS is now making a massive investment to upgrade
theirsystemstomodernarchitectures.
Summary
Many banks are struggling with modernizing their systems. Some regulatory agencies have joined the
fray.
Australia’s finance industry regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), has
expressed its lack of tolerance for service outages of Australia’s banks due to neglected legacy systems.
It understands that it is necessary for the banks to continue to replace aging systems; but APRA will not
accept outages due to institutions running outdated, unsupported operating systems, hardware, or
software.Nor will itstandfor outages caused byrunningcriticalsystems withsingle points of failureor by
losingcriticalskills.ItwarnedagainstcuttingITbudgets.
In today’s high-technology world, there is an expectation of high availabilityand high resilience for critical
services such as banking. Institutions today cannot cover up IT failures. There is no place to hide from
Twitter and Facebook. However, banking customers for the next decade can expect regular outages of
key banking systems. Banks will continue to struggle with system outages as they work to replace their
aging,decades-oldlegacybankingsystems.
