The Fragile Cloud

Caution:Cloudcomputingcanbehazardoustoyourhealth.
In our previous article, “The Fragile Internet,”1 we questioned the dependability of the Internet for
critical corporate functions. We pointed out several instances in which the Internet disappeared
for hours or days and asked what you would do if a portion of your enterprise was suddenly left
withoutInternetserviceforanextendedperiodoftime?
This quandary is magnified manyfold by a new and
emerging paradigm – cloud computing. Cloud computing
provides services that can be delivered and used over the

What is Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is an emerging business model by which users can gain access to their
applications from anywhere, at any time, through any connected device. The applications reside
in massively-scalable data centers where computational resources can be dynamically
provisionedandsharedtoachievesignificanteconomiesofscale.2
A key requirement is that cloud services must be optimized for availability, data integrity, and
security.Wewillfocusonhowwelltoday’scloudservicesmeetthesecriteria.

The first major form of cloud computing was the Grid. Then along came a variety of public
application offerings grouped under the term Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). This has expanded
intowhatweknowtodayascloudcomputing.Theultimategoalisthecomputeutility.
TheGrid
Grid computing is an array of computing devices grouped to act in concert to execute very large
tasks. An early use of grid computing was SETI@home, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial
Intelligence project, which was started in 1999 and which harnessed over 5 million PCs around
the world to parse through massive amounts of celestial data searching for any sign of
intelligence.
Attempts to standardize grid computing started at about the same time when the Global Grid
Forum (GGF) was created bymajor players in theIT industry. ThroughGGF’s efforts,theGlobus
toolkit was created to help companies build their own grids. However, this effort seems to have
gone the way of many other industry-supported standardization efforts – it has moved into
oblivion.
Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)
In the early 2000s, service providers started offering products that performed the same function
as major systems in the enterprise but which were provided via the service providers’ data
centers. With these services, which became known as Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS,
companies could decommission their internal systems and use the SaaS services instead, thus
savingsignificantcostsassociatedwithrunningtheirownsystems.
Predominant among these are the manyemail services available today, manyfor free.There are
many other examples. Salesforce.com offers Customer Relationship Management (CRM).
Google offers Google Apps, which is an ad-supported free suite of useful collaboration,
messaging,andofficeproductivityservices.
TheStorageCloud
As SaaS services matured, some companies with massive data-processing facilities moved to
make their computing facilities available to the public on a fee basis. The first steps in this
direction were to provide massive data storage in a controlled environment for companies. Thus
wasborntheStorageCloud.
A major example of the Storage Cloud is Amazon’s S3 service (Simple Storage Service). Many
othercompanies,bothsmallandlarge,offerstorageservicesforafeeorforfree.
TheComputeCloud
During this time, many companies sprouted up that offered web-hosting services on their
systems. Many of these built very large and powerful data centers. Typically, hundreds of web
sites shared one large server; and these companies built data centers with thousands of servers
hostingmillionsofsmallwebsites.Thiswasthefirstinstanceofthecomputecloud.
In many cases, SaaS providers and hosting-service providers moved to open the computing
capacity of their systems to the public, as did other companies with massive data centers.
Salesforce.com introduced force.com. Hostway, a major hosting service, introduced FlexCloud.
Rackspace, another major hosting service, introduced Mosso. Amazon introduced its Elastic
ComputeCloudservice(EC2).

Even the server and operating-system vendors are getting involved. Sun has announced its Sun
Cloud Storage Service and its Sun Cloud Compute Service. Microsoft is experimenting with its
AzureServicesPlatform.
Theseareallexamplesoftoday’sstate-of-the-artincloudcomputing.
TheComputeUtility
All of these cloud services fall short in one common area. They are all proprietary and cannot
interoperate with each other. There are many advantages to cloud interoperability, including
being able to store your data in multiple clouds and to run your applications in multiple clouds
whileaccessingyourdatainsomeothercloud.Thiswouldbetheultimateinavailability.
Sun is attacking this problem. Sun’s vision is a world of clouds that are both open and that
interoperate.TheyhaveannouncedtheSunOpenCloudPlatform,whichisacooperativeeffortin
theopen-sourcecommunitytodevelopanopenandstandardcloud.
PrivateClouds
The pubic clouds described above are made available to users via the Internet and are free or
inexpensive to use. Private clouds offer many of the same benefits as public clouds, most
importantly the dynamic allocation of compute resources as they are needed. However, private
clouds are managed within the enterprise. Private clouds can overcome some of the concerns
thatacompanymayhavewithpublicclouds,suchasavailability,control,andsecurity.

upgrade wenthorriblywrong;and Salesforce.com was downformostoftheday. Another
outage on January 5, 2006, interrupted service for almost three hours, followed by a
several-hour outage on January30th. February 9thand February 15thsaw further outages

 August 6, 2008 – An outage locked out Gmail users and Google Apps customers for 15
hours. On August 15, 2008, another outage locked out some Google users for a day.

On May 14, 2009, Google Apps went down for almost two hours. A routing error
redirected traffic through Asia, overloading data centers there. 14% of Google’s
customers (millions of users) were affected. A typical story was that of a California bank

 July 27, 2007 – Hostway, a major web-site hosting service, planned a move of a newly-
acquired data center from Miami, Florida, to Tampa, Florida. It informed its affected
customers that they would be offline twelve to fifteen hours over the weekend. However,
server problems caused by the move and network problems in the Tampa data center

hit a transformer outside of its data center. Emergency personnel would not let
Rackspace use its emergency generator or switch to backup primary power because of
danger to the rescue personnel. Thousands of web sites were down for a day while
servers were restored to service. Many of these web sites were run by SaaS providers

 May 31, 2008 – Operating six data centers, The Planet is the largest privately-held
dedicated server hosting company and the fourth largest in the world. On May 31st, a
battery-room explosion in one of its data centers blew out three interior walls and
destroyed the power-transfer switch to its backup generator. The fire department
evacuated the building. When personnel were allowed back in, they found that 9,000
servers leased by 7,500 customers were taken down by lack of power. Four days after
theexplosion,somecustomersstillremainedoffline.7
On May 12 and May 13, 2009, The Planet had short half-hour shortages when an
operator error caused IP addresses to be improperly advertised. Millions of web sites
wereaffected.
 March 3, 2009 – Media Temple, yet another major web-site host, had a storage-system
crash that corrupted its files. It was down for 38 hours while the database was restored.
