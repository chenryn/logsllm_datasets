– Our April Twitter Feed of Outages
April2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass. With our new Twitter presence, we don’t have to feel
guilty.Thisarticlehighlightssomeofthetweetsthatmadeheadlinesinrecentdays.

Technology is the most important agent of change today; hardly any industry is immune to both its
value-creating and disruptive potential. However, in an April 2011 survey of corporate directors by
McKinsey Quarterly, more than half said their boards had only one technology-related discussion a

911SystemDoneinbyaMalfunctioningAirConditioner
Erie County’s (in U.S. state of New York) 911 system shut down for nearly four hours on a
Wednesday morning in March – done in by a malfunctioning air conditioner. And the failures didn’t
stop there. The back-up system didn’t work either, and more than half an hour passed before
anyone realized it. County dispatchers headed to a secondary location in Cheektowaga only to
discover that emergency calls that were supposed to be diverted there weren’t coming in. Now
lawmakers want answers about how this could occur after spending tens of millions of dollars in
recentyearson911equipment,maintenance,trainingandtesting.

Seeingnoendtopowercrisis,Gazansturntosolarpower
Faced with power blackouts lasting anything from eight to 12 hours a day, residents and businesses
in Gaza are increasingly turning to the sun to supply their energy needs. Not only are solar panels
more reliable and cheaper in the long run, but in some cases, including that of Tamer al-Burai, they
havebecomeessentialtostayingalive.

Availability Digest Oldie but Goodie: "Anti-Virus - A Single Point of Failure?" McAfee's Nightmare
Updatein2010
What do active/active systems, clusters, fault-tolerant systems, and standby systems have in
common? They all avoid a single point of failure. True, fault-tolerant systems and clusters will not
survive a site failure; and standby systems have been known not to come up when needed. But
active/active systems are immune, right? On April 21, 2010, McAfee, one of the leading antivirus
vendors, proved this conjecture to be wrong. It sent out an antivirus update that immediately took
downhundredsof thousands–maybemillions–ofcomputersworldwide.Thisone badupdatecould
have stopped every node in an active/active system, and our “indestructible system” would have

Report: Almost Half of IT Migrations Doomed to Fail
Complex IT migrations, much like a house of cards, can crumble when a single weak link –
hardware, legacy software and applications, or a poor choice of cloud vendor – throws the
system out of whack. Even when downtimes are planned, nearly half the time systems are down
longer than folks in the C-suite anticipate.

Survey:Techexecsunder-preparedfordowntimeandextracostsduringITmigrations
In a recent survey of 2,000 global IT executives, 44% responded that their organizations had failed
at some type of IT migration. Around 70% of those surveyed alsosaid they were not prepared for
downtime and additional costs that occur with migration issues. When systems do go down, almost
halfofexecutivessaid the systemoutages lasted longerthanhigh-level executives expect.

HowtoAvoidStormBlackouts?CollegesGoBigWithMicrogrids
MIT and other top engineering institutions are showcasing ultra-efficient, innovative ways to
produce theirown energy. In the last year,several have unveiled plans to expand orbuild new
campus plants; and Stanford’s cutting-edge system uses mostlysolar power—not fossil fuel.
They’re seeking eco-friendlyfreedom from the central power grid, which can be vulnerable to
extreme weather or cyberattacks.While colleges have long embraced on-site power plants,
aka microgrids, their interest accelerated aftermajor storms—notablySandyin 2012—knocked

An AvailabilityDigestOldiebutGoodie:"PoorDocumentationSnagsGoogle."
In February 2010, what should have been a ten-minute outage at a major Google data center
hosting the Google App Engine turned into a two-and-a-half hour ordeal simply because of faulty
failover documentation. Of course, the fact that the failover procedures were incorrectly documented
alsoimpliesthattheywerenevertestedandthatthestaffwasnevertrained.

NationalGridtoTestNewUtilityMicrogridServices
How will utilities make money as more customers generate their own electricity? That’s one of the
big looming industry questions, one that National Grid is trying to solve by testing new utility
microgrid services. Amicrogrid is a local energy grid with control capability, which means it can
disconnect from the traditional grid and operate autonomously.The utility plans to try out the
services in Potsdam,New York, where it is installing a microgrid with Clarkson University, General
ElectricandNovaEnergySpecialists.

'Fairlycatastrophic'SEPTAoutageexplained
Rail service on one of SEPTA's busiest lines died Thursday night 10 March. SEPTA is the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. It operates various forms of public transit
services in and around Philadelphia, PA (USA). Hundreds of passengers stranded on trains had to
be returned to the neareststationandtaken to theirdestinations bybus.Manythousandsmoreused
roundabout routes to get home. The root of the problem was a weak spot developing in the catenary
due to friction against a steady span wire. The age of the system, portions of which are a century
old,waslikelyafactor.
