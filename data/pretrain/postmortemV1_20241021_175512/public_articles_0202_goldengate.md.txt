Flexible Availability Options with GoldenGate’s Transactional
Data Management Platform (TDM)
February2007
Active/active systems achieve their extraordinary availabilities by recovering from a fault in
seconds.Ineffect,theactive/activephilosophyistoletasystemfail,butfixitfast.
Inorder torecover soquickly,thesesystems areconfiguredas a network of nodes,eachactively
processing transactions for a common application. Should a node fail, the users at that node are
simplyswitchedtoasurvivingnode.
Toensuresurvivabilityoftheapplicationnetwork,theremustbeatleasttwoapplicationdatabase
copies, which are separated geographically. These database copies must be synchronized so
thatallapplicationsrunningatdifferentnodesseethesamedata.
A common method to achieve database synchronism is to replicate changes that are made at
each database to the other database copies in the network. An example of such a solution is the
Transactional Data Management (TDM) platform from GoldenGate Software, Inc.
(www.goldengate.com).

The Transactional Data Management Platform
WhatIsTDM?
TDM1 captures database changes made to an operational source database and moves them
asynchronously to a target database in near real time with low latency (the time from when a
changeismadetothesourcedatabasetothetimethatitisappliedtothetargetdatabase).Itcan
be configured to be unidirectional, replicating in one direction, or bidirectional, replicating in both
directions.
Flexible network technologies are unidirectional
supported. TDM can be configured
in a multinode peer-to-peer
bidirectional
configuration (active/active). It can
broadcast
be configured to broadcast data active/active
changes from a master database to
multiple slave databases or to
consolidate changes made to
several database copies onto a
master database. It can support
cascading of data down a multi- consolidate tiering
tiereddatabasestructure.
GoldenGateTopologies
TDM configurations can be heterogeneous. The databases, the hardware platforms, and the
operating systems can all be different. TDM supports data transformation between the source
and target databases to support heterogeneity, whether it be simply different data structures in
otherwiseidenticaldatabasesordatabasesystemsfromdifferentvendors.
The communication of changes between the source and target systems is via an IP network.
Thereisnolimitationonthedistancebetweendatabases.
TDM supports dynamic rollback and reconstruction of a database for rapid recovery from errors
that may have contaminated the database. Before-images are used to create reverse
transactions to a specified point in time that is known to correspond to an accurate database.
After-images are then used to create transactions to return the database to its proper current
state.Dynamicrollbackobviatestheneedforafulldatareloadtorecoveracorrupteddatabase.
TheTDMArchitecture
TDM is implemented as a set of decoupled processes that can proceed independently of each
other. For instance, if the process that updates the target database is slower than the process
thatreadsthesourcedatabase,thesourceprocessdoesnothavetopause.Itcancontinueonat
its natural speed by simply queuing database changes to disk for later processing by the target
process.
The TDM processes and other components include a Capture process that receives changes to
the source database, a communications facility to send source database changes to the target
system, a Delivery process to apply changes to the target database, Trail Files to provide
persistent storage of database changes, and a Manager process to control the processes at a
node.

Capture
Theroleof theCaptureprocess is toreceiveallchanges tothesourcedatabase. Thesechanges
couldcomefrom avarietyof sources.Theymightbeextractedfrom atransactionlog(redologor
audit trail) maintained by the source database or transaction manager. If such a log is not
available, changes may be fed to the Capture process directly by the application or by an
intercept library embedded in the application; or they may be fed by change information
generatedbydatabasetriggers.
The Capture process will filter out intermediate activities and rolled-back operations. It will only
forwardchangescorrespondingtocompletedtransactions. Itaccomplishesthisbywaitingforthe
transaction’sCOMMIToperationbeforesendingthetransactionupdatestothetargetside.
TheCapture process canbeinstructedto onlyforward changes from selectedtables or rows and
optionallycancompresschangedatatospeedprocessing.
TrailFiles
DatachangescapturedbytheCaptureprocessarewrittentothesource-sideTrailFile.Sincethe
Capture process filters out aborted transactions, the Trail File contains only committed
transactions. The Trail File is therefore a queue of transactions to be sent to the target system.
There may also be a target system Trail File which will queue changes prior to applying them to
thetargetdatabase.
Prior to writing to the Trail File, the change data format is converted to GoldenGate’s Universal
DataFormat(UDF).Thisfacilitateslaterconversiontotheformatofthetargetdatabase.

has made it to the Trail File is concerned. The Trail Files are implemented outside of the
databasestoprotectthemfromdatabasefailures.
Communications
The transfer of data changes from the source system to the target system is via IP (the Internet
Protocol). The communication channel can be any medium that supports IP, such as WANs,
LANs, the Internet, or fiber. Therefore, there is no geographical limit on the separation of the
sourcesystemfromthetargetsystem.

Data changes are blocked and optionally compressed to improve communication efficiency.

Delivery

Where possible, the Delivery process uses the data-change information to update the target
database via the target database’s native SQL. If the database does not have a native SQL,

TDM can be configured so that the order of transaction commits at the source database is
preservedwhenapplyingthesecommitstothetargetdatabase.Inthis way,referentialintegrityat

Manager
The Manager controls the TDM processes on its node via a command-line interface. It provides
the facilities for TDM configuration, critical event and threshold monitoring, log resource
management,andthemanagementandpurgingofoldTrailFiles.
TDM resources across the enterprise can be monitored with the GoldenGate Director, described
later.
TransformationandMapping
Database changes captured from the source database can be mapped and transformed into the
formats required by the target database via GoldenGate-supplied functions, by user-supplied
code installed as user exits, or by stored procedures in the database. Data mapping and
transformationcanbedoneeitherbytheCaptureprocess,bytheDeliveryprocess,orbyboth.
The user can specifytable or row filtering and which columns are affected. GoldenGate functions

ConflictDetectionandResolution

A data collision occurs when two users each attempt to modify
the same row at the same time at two different nodes. TDM can
detect collisions and can be directed to take one of several rowa
actions,including: X

ZeroDowntimeOperations
TDM can support upgrades to the system as well as migration to new system components
without incurring planned downtime. Migration is accomplished by starting capture on the source
system, loading a snapshot of the database onto the new target system, and then applying all of
the new database updates that have accumulated since the capture was begun. Once the target

In a multinode system, planned downtime for maintenance and upgrades can be avoided by
switching users from the node to be worked on to other nodes in the application network so that
