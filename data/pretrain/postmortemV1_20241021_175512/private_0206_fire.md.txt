Fire in the Computer Room, What Now?
June2007
Heading to work, you hear on the radio that your office building has just burned down. Your cell
phone rings. It’s the CEO asking what your plans are to recover. How soon will it be before you
have recovered the company records and are providing data processing services again? You
haveplannedforthis,haven’tyou?
The recovery from a disaster such as this requires extensive disaster recovery planning long
before a disaster strikes. This book, Fire in the Computer Room, What Now?1 walks us through
the creation of a Disaster Recovery Plan to handle just this sort of situation.2 Following such a
disaster,ifyouhavetoask,“WhatNow?,”thenitisalreadytoolatetocreatethisplan.
What is a Disaster?

Disastersinclude:
 Local site disasters (computer room) – fire, flood, catastrophic system failure, power
failure,sabotage.
 Sitedisasters(building)–bombings,explosions,fire,flood,poweroutages.
 Area disasters (metropolitan) – bombings, earthquakes, environmental contamination,
explosions, disease outbreaks, plane crashes, volcanic eruptions, wind or snow storms,
terroristattacks.

The Disaster Recovery Plan
Recovery from a disaster that destroys a data center or renders it inoperable for an extended
period of time can only be done by migrating to a backup data center. The Disaster Recovery
Plandefinestheneedsofthebackupdatacenterandtheproceduresforswitchingovertoit.
Creating a Disaster Recovery Plan is not a simple exercise, and its execution is not inexpensive.

DetermineWhattheBusinessRequirementsAre
This first step involves the preparation of a Risk Analysis and a Business Impact Analysis. These
analyses identify what the business process priorities are and what recovery time is required for
eachbusinessprocess.
RiskAnalysis
The Risk Analysis identifies the risks that the corporation faces. These risks include but are not
limitedto:
 thephysicalsecurityofthefacilityitself.
 theprotectionofthebusiness’sdata.
 disgruntledemployees.
 backupandrecoverysystems.
 thevulnerabilityoftheinfrastructure,suchaspower,communications,andwater.

 thelocationofthedatacenter(thatis,towhatdisastersisitsusceptible).
 keyskillsuponwhichthebusinessisdependent.
BusinessImpactAnalysis
A business process is a group of related activities that support the successful operation of the
business. A business process may include data processing applications. It is the recovery of
criticaldataprocessingapplicationsthatisthesubjectofaDisasterRecoveryPlan.
TheBusinessImpactAnalysiscovers:
 whichbusinessprocessesshouldbeincludedinthescopeoftherecovery.
 the cost in terms of lost revenue, lost customers, or other metrics of an outage to each
businessprocess.
 themaximumallowabletimeofanoutageforeachbusinessprocess.
 theacceptableamountofunrecoverabletransactionsforeachbusinessprocess.
 therecoverypriorityforeachbusinessprocess.
 thedependenciesbetweenbusinessprocesses.
DeterminetheDataProcessingRequirements
Oncethe needs of the business are understood, these canbetranslated intothe procedures and
resourcesneededtosupportrecoveryandongoingprocessingattherecoverysite.
The data processing requirements at the backup site are determined by creating an inventory of
all of the applications used by the business. Each application should be assigned recovery
attributes that are necessary to meet the critical needs of the business. For each application,
theseattributesinclude:
 themaximumacceptabledowntime.
 themaximumtolerabledataloss.
 thedatacurrencyrequireduponresumptionofprocessingatthebackupsite.
 hardwarecapacityrequirements(processors,disks,tapes,printers).
 networkrequirements.
 servicelevelstobemaintainedduringandafterrecovery.
DesigntheBackup/RecoverySolution
The disaster recoverydesign defines the scope of the recovery– that is, what is being recovered
inwhattimeframe.Thedesignincludes:
 whattypesofdisastersareincludedinandexcludedfromtherecovery.
 thesequenceinwhichapplicationswillberecovered.
 themaximumrecoverytimeforeachapplication.
 thedatathatwillberecovered.
 thecurrencyofthedataonceitisrecovered.
The strategy for testing the backup site must be determined. Is the backup site company-owned
or providedunder contract withathird party? Cantestingbecarriedon atthe backupsitewithout
impacting applications which the backup site is normally running? How frequently should testing
bedone?
The backup and recovery processes are defined in detail during this step. These processes are
the heart of the Disaster Recovery Plan. The most important process within this group is the

backup and recoveryof data. The corporate data is one of the company’s most important assets.
The plan should address how data will be backed up, how it will be stored safely off-site
(physically or electronically), how it will be retrieved following a disaster, and how it will be
recovered.
The data backup requirements will be different for different classes of data. Data classes include
applicationdata,metadata,andsystemdata.
Some data will be lost following a disaster. This could range from data that had not yet been
backed up to data stored on unreadable or lost magnetic tapes. Procedures should be
determined for reconstructing lost data that is so critical that its loss cannot be tolerated. This
includes correcting inconsistencies between related files or tables. Furthermore, data must be
resynchronizedbetweenitselectroniccopyandothermedia,suchaspaperormicrofiche.
Thereadinessofthebackupsitemustbespecified.Is itacoldsite,a warm site,orahotsitewith
an up-to-date database and all applications running? Is the site unmanned, manned, or operable
remotely? If the site is unmanned, there should be remote monitoring of environmental
parameterssuchaspower,temperature,andhumidity.
Finally, the configuration of the backup site must be specified. This includes not only the obvious
hardware requirements, but also the networking interconnections between the primary site and
the backup site. In addition, there may be requirements imposed on the applications and
databases. Applications should be designed to be portable, avoiding complex linkages with other
applications. Databases should be designed so that they are self-contained, and they should
consistofsmall,transferablepartitions.

Theselection of hardware andsoftware products will bedependent uponthe processingplatform
at the primary site since the data and procedures used at that site will be transferred to the
backupsitefollowingarecovery.
The first step is to choose a backup site if one does not already exist. Thereafter, product
selectionwillbebasedonneed,compatibility,functionality,productquality,andcost.
ImplementtheBackup/RecoverySolution
This is the implementation phase. The backup site is acquired and provisioned if necessary with
theappropriatehardwareandsoftware.Newdatabackup,storage,andrecoveryproceduresmay
havetobeputinplace.Thebackupsiteconfigurationandproceduresmustbeintegratedintothe
company’schangemanagementprocesses.
Revised application design rules should be put in place to ensure that new applications and
databases are backup/recovery-ready. Human resource procedures should be reviewed to cover
issues such as employee notification following a disaster, who works and who doesn’t,
compensation,counseling,andongoingstatusnotificationtoemployees.
At this point, the Disaster Recovery Plan should be formalized, approved, and documented. It
shouldinclude:
 therecoveryscopeandassumptions.
 theprocessforrecognizingadisasterandinvokingtheplan.

 themajortasksandresponsibilitiesoftherecoveryteams.
 theowneroftheplan.
 howtheplanwillbemaintained.
 howtheplanwillbetested.
KeeptheSolutionUp-to-Date
Changes to the data processing environment in a data center are constant, and any change has
thepotentialofrenderingtheDisasterRecoveryPlanuseless.Therefore,proceduresmustbeput
inplacetokeepitviable.Theseproceduresincludemaintenance,auditing,andtesting.
Maintenance
Changes may come from the development of new applications, changes to hardware
configurations,changestothenetwork,organizationalchanges,system changes,andchangesto
thebackupsite.
The Disaster RecoveryPlan must be part of the change management process to ensure that it is
updatedtoreflectanychangethatimpactsit.
Auditing
The plan should be independently audited periodically. Typical audit periods are six months or a
year.
Testing
Perhaps the most essential part of a viable Disaster Recovery Plan is periodic testing of the
recoveryprocedures.Thisprovidesseveralimportantfunctions:

Testing the recovery plan can itself cause a disaster, especially in the early tests. During the
design of the Disaster Recovery Plan, the potential negative impact of a test gone wrong should
beconsidered,andproceduresshouldbeinplacetoquicklyrecoverfromsuchproblems.
Summary
TheprocessforcreatingaDisasterRecoveryPlandetailedbytheauthorsinFireintheComputer
Room, What Now? is not reallya strict sequence of actions. Often, information from afuture step
is useful in an earlier step, such as having an idea of available backup and recovery hardware
and software options when designing the plan. Furthermore, the development of one step may
impactprevioussteps,whichmustbereworked.
