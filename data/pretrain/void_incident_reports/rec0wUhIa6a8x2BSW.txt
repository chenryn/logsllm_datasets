IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
The very next day, the Datastores EMEA team got the same page. After looking into it, the team discovered that the problem was similar to the one experienced the day before, but worse. Similar actions were taken to keep the cluster in working condition, but there was an edge-case bug in Datastores automation which led to failure to handle a flood of requests. Unfortunately, this incident did impact some customers, and they werenâ€™t able to load Slack. We disabled specific features to help reduce the load on the cluster, which helped give room to recover. After a while, the job finished, and the database cluster operated normally again.

ANALYSIS RESULTS
----------------
Caused by Software Change: Yes
Software Change Type: Code Deployments
Reasoning: The incident was caused by the 'forget user' asynchronous job's performance inefficiencies and query patterns, which are part of application code logic; subsequent optimizations and restructuring of this job were implemented to mitigate the issue.
