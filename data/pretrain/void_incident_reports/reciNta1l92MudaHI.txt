IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
Following a large bot import to the Russian Wikinews, expanding the size of that project to 13 million pages, slow queries originating from ruwikinews's usage of the DynamicPageList extension (also known as "intersection") overloaded the s3 cluster of databases, causing php-fpm processes to hang/stall, eventually taking down all wikis with it.
