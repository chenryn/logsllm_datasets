IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
We accidentally submitted an incorrect change to the templating of our infrastructure provisioning system. This deleted all of the microservices responsible for serving skyscanner.net and data to our mobile app from the underlying infrastructure across the entire globe, causing a four-hour outage. We’re really sorry for the impact that caused our travellers and partners and we’ve put in several mitigations to prevent it from happening again.
