IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
On September 17, 2024, during routine maintenance, Cloudflare inadvertently stopped announcing fifteen IPv4 prefixes, affecting some Business plan websites for approximately one hour. During this time, IPv4 traffic for these customers would not have reached Cloudflare, and users attempting to connect to websites assigned addresses within those prefixes would have received errors.

ANALYSIS RESULTS
----------------
Caused by Software Change: Yes
Software Change Type: Code Deployments
Reasoning: The incident was caused by a prior code update to a function involved in IP address synchronization, which introduced a bug that suppressed updates for websites without legacy SSL certificates, leading to incomplete renumbering and subsequent withdrawal of active IPv4 prefixes.
