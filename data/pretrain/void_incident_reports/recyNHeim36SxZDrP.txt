IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
A recent change to how chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave, â€¦) does spellchecking can cause the performance of the Editor experience to slow down.,The performance impact will be relative to the size of document and number of words which are identified as misspelt by the chrome browser (red squiggle underline).,As this performance issue is coming from the browsers built in spellchecking, Atlassian is limited in how we can mitigate the issue.,The current suggested workaround is to disable spellchecking on chrome://settings/languages, Downgrade Chrome, or use an alternate browser,Chrome have fixed the issue in Chrome 97 which is currently in Beta and due to become Stable on January 4th .,The chromium bug also has reports of this issue impacting other web based editors such as Dropbox, Notion and Wikipedia.,https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1271918
