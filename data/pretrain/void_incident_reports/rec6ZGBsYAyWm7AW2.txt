IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
Unfortunately, if you were browsing the site, or at least trying, during the afternoon of March 14th during US hours, you may have seen our unfortunate Snoo during the 314-minute outage Reddit faced (on Pi day no less!) Or maybe you just saw the homepage with no posts. Or an error. One way or another, Reddit was definitely broken. But it wasnâ€™t you, it was us.

ANALYSIS RESULTS
----------------
Caused by Software Change: Yes
Software Change Type: Infrastructure Changes
Reasoning: The incident was caused by an upgrade to the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure (from version 1.23 to 1.24), which included changes to control plane components and container runtime, leading to a failure in cluster networking and control plane functionality.
