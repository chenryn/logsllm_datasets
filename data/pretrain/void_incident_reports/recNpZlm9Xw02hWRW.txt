- Buildkite

TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED

- Redis

IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
Around 2022-11-19 13:00 UTC, a small subset of agents disconnected and failed to reconnect again. From 2022-11-21 02:35 to 03:10 UTC, high Agent API error rates prevented agents from successfully processing jobs. After this point, newly connected agents could successfully execute jobs, but older agents still couldn't reconnect. From 2022-11-21 05:54 UTC, older agents were successfully reconnected.

ANALYSIS RESULTS
----------------
Caused by Software Change: Yes
Software Change Type: Database Changes
Reasoning: The incident was caused by backfilling a new database table and managing a large Redis set that exceeded memory constraints, leading to eviction of critical heartbeat data and subsequent agent connectivity issues.
