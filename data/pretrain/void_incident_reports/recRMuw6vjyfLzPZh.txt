IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
Between 20:52:27 UTC on 2023-03-16 and 02:30:00 UTC on 2023-03-17, the Heroku API was unavailable. This incident also impacted most Heroku CLI and Dashboard operations for Common Runtime, Private Spaces, Salesforce Functions, and Heroku Data. Customers could not log in, access dashboard metrics, perform releases, add log drains, or start, restart, or stop dynos. In addition, customers could not provision new add-ons, de-provision old ones, or use tools such as heroku pg:sql which depend on the Heroku API for authorization. Customer applications and add-ons already running during this time were not impacted.
