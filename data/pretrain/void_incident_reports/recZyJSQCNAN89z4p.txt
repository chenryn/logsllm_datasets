IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
Today’s post is a little different. It’s about a single customer’s website not working correctly because of incorrect action taken by Cloudflare. Although the customer was not in any way banned from Cloudflare, or lost access to their account, their website didn’t work. And it didn’t work because Cloudflare applied a bandwidth throttle between us and their origin server. The effect was that the website was unusable.
