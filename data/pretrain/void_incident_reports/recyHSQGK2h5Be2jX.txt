IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
Google Cloud Pubsub experienced problems creating new subscriptions and viewing backlog statistics for a period of 2 hours and 37 minutes. The Pubsub issue also caused issues with Google Cloud Functions deployments and affected related Google Cloud Dataflow streaming jobs and watermarks. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an unhealthy task in our Pubsub change notification system that created a feedback loop with increased errors on backlog stats which scaled up more tasks and put more load on our Pubsub change notification system. Google Cloud Dataflow Streaming jobs that interact with PubSub were stalled due to the dependency of those jobs on Backlog Stats which are required to calculate the watermark.
