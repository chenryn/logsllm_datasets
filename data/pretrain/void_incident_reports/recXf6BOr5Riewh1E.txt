IMPACT DESCRIPTION
------------------
On October 4, 2021 from around 8:46 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties connecting to Slack. Due to a third party website's outage, DNS (Domain Name System) resolvers around the internet saw a large increase in traffic as clients tried to get valid DNS results, causing timeouts on some DNS resolvers. Users relying on the impacted DNS resolvers may have experienced errors when connecting Slack and some other web services.
