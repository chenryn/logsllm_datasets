{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI love using Prometheus for monitoring and alerting. Until now, all my targets (nodes and containers) lived on the same network as the monitoring server.But now I'm facing a scenario, where we will deploy our application stack (as a bunch of Docker containers) to several client machines in thier networks. Nearly all of the clients networks are behind a firewall or NAT. So scraping becomes quite difficult.As we're still accountable for our stack, I'd like to have a central montioring server, altering and dashboards.I was wondering what could be the best architecture if want to implement it with Prometheus, but I couldn't find any convincing approaches. My ideas so far:Use a Pushgatewayon our side and push all data out of the client networks. As the docs state, it's not intended that way:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/Use a federation setup(https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/): Place a Prometheus server in every client network behind a reverse proxy (to enable SSL and authentication) and aggregate relevant metricts there. Open/forward just a single port for federation scraping.Other more experimental setups, such as SSH Tunneling (e.g. herehttps://miek.nl/2016/february/24/monitoring-with-ssh-and-prometheus/) or VPN!?Thank you in advance for your help!\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["Nobody posted an answer so I will try to give my opinion on the second choice because that's what I think I would do in your situation.The second setup seems the most flexible, you have access to the datas and only need to open one port on for the federating server, so it should still be secure.One other bonus of this type of setup is that even if the firewall stop working for a reason or another, you will still have a prometheus scraping, you will have an alert because you won't be able to access the server(s) but when the connexion comes again you will have all the datas. You won't have a hole in the grafana dashboards because there was no datas, apart during the incident.The issue with this setup is the fact that you need to maintain a number of server equivalent to the number of networks. A solution for this would be to have a packer image or maybe an ansible playbook to deploy."]]}

You can then either use docker run -v to inject that same directory into the Filebeat container, or just run Filebeat directly on the host (if its principal job is reading host-system files...).\nIf you have the option and are in a more productiony setup, switching log drivers to point at your logstash is also a good idea, but that will only collect the main process's stdout and stderr (instead of having to run docker logs that data will show up on your central log server).  That won't collect the per-Jenkins-job log files, though.\nMy experience agrees with the Vagrant bug you quote: never look inside /var/lib/docker, and especially don't try to mount Docker's internal state into a Docker container.

You can then have a variety of solutions you can pursue, from running a syslog service inside your container to exposing the hosts's /dev/log inside the container.\nAnother options is to run systemd inside your container, and use this to start your services.  systemd will collect stdout/stderr from your services and feed that to journald, and journald will take care of things like log rotation (and also give you a reasonably flexible mechanism for querying the logs).\n"]]}

This could happen if the event you're measuring with the graph never happened or there was an issue with publishing the metric. Both of these are valid scenarios.\nHowever, CloudWatch launched the metric math feature in April 2018 and one of the functions supported with the metric math is FILL (see the answer below of this answer on how to use it).\nFILL doesn't just connect the lines to make the graph pretty. It will actually interpolate the missing values and insert them into the graph (only the graph, not the actual datastore). This hides the above-mentioned scenarios of missing data. This could be fine, but it could also cause issues and unpredicted behavior depending on the use case.

Your logger is an implicit descendant of the root logger. You set the handler to level DEBUG, but not the logger using that handler. \nSince the level on your logger still is NOTSET, when a log event occurs, its chain of ancestors is traversed ... \n\n... until either an ancestor with a level other than NOTSET is found, or\n  the root is reached.\n[...]\nIf the root is reached, and it has a level of NOTSET, then all\n  messages will be processed. Otherwise, the root’s level will be used\n  as the effective level.\n\nWhich means, you immediately end up at the root logger to determine the effective log level; it is set to WARNING as per the root logger's default.\nYou can check this with the parent and level properties and the getEffectiveLevel method on the logger object:\nlogThis = get_logger()\nprint(logThis.parent)               # <RootLogger root (WARNING)>\nprint(logThis.level)                # 0 (= NOTSET)\nprint(logThis.getEffectiveLevel())  # 30 (= WARNING) from root logger\n\nTo have your logger handle the messages on and above the desired level itself, simply set it on the logger via NOTSET0 in your NOTSET1 function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nImprove this answer\n\n\n\n                        Follow\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedited Nov 28, 2018 at 6:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            answered Nov 26, 2018 at 8:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshmeeshmee\n\n4,90122 gold badges2222 silver badges2929 bronze badges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a comment\n | \n\n\n\n\n"]]}

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI have an application that I have to monitor every 5 mins. However, that application does not have a /metrics port for Prometheus to directly scrape from and I don't have any control over that application.As a workaround, I wrote a python program to manually scrape the data, and transforms those data to my own metrics such as gauge and counters.

Now, I want to take a step further by using the AWS Lambda function to pull data and generate metrics for me every 5 mins(so I don't have to keep the python program running on my laptop).My question would be, instead of using:push_to_gateway(gateway='localhost:9091', job=\"Monitor\", registry=registry)to push my metrics to pushgateway, what would this be in the lambda function?

Or if there are particular use cases in which to use one or the other?Thanks in advance.\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["Those are completely different things. Prometheus Operator is a tool created by CoreOS to simplify deployment and management of Prometheus instances in K8s. Using Prometheus Operator you can very easily deploy Prometheus, Alertmanager, Prometheus alert rules and Service Monitors.Prometheus Adapter is required for using Custom Metrics API in K8s. It is used primarily for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale based on metrics retrieved from Prometheus. For example, you can create metrics inside of your application and collect them using Prometheus and then you can scale based on those metrics which is really good, because by default K8s is able to scale based only on raw metrics of CPU and memory usage which is not suitable in many cases.So actually those two things can nicely complement each other."]]}

And I want to know if Prometheus can detect these alerts without making any modifications to the code inside the existing pods.\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["The common way for prometheus to extract metrics and health is by the use of scraping (thru an http endpoint is the most common).

It is a cluster level component which periodically scrapes metrics from all Kubernetes nodes served by Kubelet through Summary API. The metrics are aggregated, stored in memory and served in Metrics API format. The metric-server stores the latest values only and is not responsible for forwarding metrics to third-party destinations.kube-state-metricsis focused on generating completely new metrics from Kubernetes' object state (e.g. metrics based on deployments, replica sets, etc.). It holds an entire snapshot of Kubernetes state in memory and continuously generates new metrics based off of it.

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nIf we configure kube-prometheus-stack with replicas = 2, then two instances of Prometheus get running. However no Thanos Query is deployed for aggregation. Then how is the aggregation of data with deduplication is provided for these two instances by kube-prometheus-stack?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["There is no aggregation or state sharing - what you are getting is basically two independent prometheuses, which are scrapping same targets. Seehttps://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/operator/high-availability/The Prometheus instances scrape the same targets and evaluate the same rules, hence they will have the same data in memory and on disk, with a slight twist that given their different external label, the scrapes and evaluations won’t happen at exactly the same time. As a consequence, query requests executed against each Prometheus instance may return slightly different results.Deduplication of alerts is happening on AlertManager side. So having two or more prometheuses provides only high availability, and not scaling.Running multiple Prometheus instances avoids having a single point of failure but it doesn’t help scaling out Prometheus in case a single Prometheus instance can’t handle all the targets and rules.As for using Grafana or any other visualization tool - you should configure sticky sessions, to query single instance at a timeFor dashboarding, sticky sessions (using sessionAffinity on the Kubernetes Service) should be used, to get consistent graphs when refreshing or you can use something like Thanos Querier to federate the data."]]}

It seems very easy to place it inside the cluster. But that seems less robust.\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["It seems people do this typically, likely they are running everything in their environment or app under K8S. In a bigger picture view if you have use cases outside of one specific app it likely makes sense to run this on another architecture. The reason why is that Prometheus doesn't support clustering. You can write to two instances, but there is not really an HA plan for this product. To me, that's a major problem for a monitoring technology.Most organizations who use this tool heavily end up not meeting use cases which APM (transaction tracing and diagnostics) can do. Additionally, you'll need to deploy an ELK/Splunk type stack, so it gets very complex. They also find it difficult to manage and often will look towards a Datadog, SingalFx, Sysdig, or another system which can do more and is fully managed. Naturally, most of what I have said here has cost, so if you do not have a budget then you'll have to spend your time (time=money) doing all the work."]]}
{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI am trying to figure out how to best collect metrics from a set of spring boot based services running within a Kubernetes cluster. Looking at the various docs, it seems that the choice for internal monitoring is between Actuator or Spectator with metrics being pushed to an external collection store such as Redis or StatsD or pulled, in the case of Prometheus.Since the number of instances of a given service is going to vary, I dont see how Prometheus can be configured to poll those running services since it will lack knowledge of them. I am also building around a Eureka service registry so not sure if that is polled first in this configuration.Any real world insight into this kind of approach would be welcome.\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["You should use the Prometheus java client (https://www.robustperception.io/instrumenting-java-with-prometheus/) for instrumenting.

Or is it a whole lot different from Kibana?Please correct me if I'm wrong but so far, according to my research, both are for logs. Grafana is more of visualization only, while Kibana is for searching the logs; is this right?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["Grafana is afork of Kibanabut they have developed in totally different directions since 2013.1. Logs vs MetricsKibana focuses more on logs and adhoc search while Grafana focuses more on creating dashboards for visualizing time series data. This means Grafana is usually used together with Time Series databases like Graphite, InfluxDB or Elasticsearch with aggregations. Kibana is usually used for searching logs.Metric queries tend to be really fast while searching logs is slower so they are usually used for different purposes. For example, I could look at a metric for memory usage on a server over the last 3 months and get an answer nearly instantly.Brian Brazil (Prometheus) haswritten about logs vs metrics.2. Data SourcesKibana is for ElasticSearch and the ELK stack. Grafana supports lots ofdata sources. Even if you are using Grafana with ElasticSearch, you would not usually look at the same data (logs) as in Kibana. It would be data from Logstash or MetricBeat that can be aggregated (grouped by) rather than raw logs.With Grafana you can mix and match data sources in the same dashboard e.g. ElasticSearch and Splunk.ConclusionKibana and Grafana have some overlap. Kibana has TimeLion for metrics and Grafana has the Table Panel for logs. Lots of companies use both - Kibana for logs and Grafana for visualizing metrics.They are different from each other so there will be a learning curve."]]}

You have to think about monitoring as 3 sets of data, which unfortunately in OSS you need a large mix of tools and projects. The fundamentals of monitoring consist of metrics (numbers such as what Grafana is good at visualizing), events (unstructured text such as what ELK is good at collecting and visualizing), and metadata (relationships, configuration, and other elements which span the other two categories).Most people will use different technology stacks for each.Metrics:Graphite - Old, but well proven (uses RRD data stores)InfluxDB - Newest, but less proven. Probably the best technology todayPrometheus - Uses a proprietary binary file based data store.Events:ElasticSearch - Java based unstructured data store, needs a lot of hardware to scale.Once you have the metrics and events to visualize you'll need a bunch of tools. On ElasicSearch the ELK stack is most common E = ElasticSearch L = Logstash (ingesting logs) K = Kibana (visualization).

Instrumenting your core library code with Micrometer allows the libraries to be included in applications that ship metrics to different backends.Contains built-in support for AppOptics, Azure Monitor, Netflix Atlas, CloudWatch, Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic, Ganglia, Graphite, Humio, Influx/Telegraf, JMX, KairosDB, New Relic, Prometheus, SignalFx, Google Stackdriver, StatsD, and Wavefront.\"ShareFollowansweredSep 24, 2021 at 10:56RBoroRBoro11111 silver badge44 bronze badges1Would it be correct to say that Micrometer is a specification and the Prometheus client or Dropwizard client are implementations ?

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nWe use Prometheus to watch metrics of our own application. The API of our application offers an endpoint to deliver the metrics to Prometheus. Prometheus is scraping the information every 30s.Based on the metrics we defined some alerts, which are firing to Alertmanager and then trigger email alerting, Slack messages or are shown in Alerta.From time to time our application can't deliver the metrics and the Prometheus scraper is running in a timeout. Whenever a metric is missing in such a moment, the corresponding alert gets cleared (within Email, Slack, Alerta).After 30sec our application delivers metrics again and a new alert is raised by Prometheus (which again triggers Emails, Slack messages and shows up a new alert in Alerta).A missing metric is no reason to clear out an alert if no metric is given, on which the clearance of an alert might be based on (at least in our opinion).Is there any option to configure Prometheus or Alertmanager in a way, that an alert is only solved/cleared if a metric leads to that (instead of interpreting the lack of metric as a clearance of an alert)?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["This can be done by using the aggregation functionlast_over_time().For example, say your metric of interest is:probe_successAnd your alert expression currently is:probe_success == 0This will return no value if the metric is absent, and thus your alert clears creating the issue you described.Instead change your alert expression to:last_over_time(probe_success[12h]) == 0That will instead return the last metric value that was recorded in the past 12 hours.

We keep the files as-is and do post-processing on them directly with Spark (\"Data Lake\" approach).We now want to create some visualization and I thought of setting up Cassandra on the cluster running Spark and HDFS (where the files are stored).

I use this approach because we have other stream processing jobs that do on the fly calculations as well.I now thought of writing a small REST service that makes Grafana's Simple JSON datasource usable to pull the data in and visualize it. So far so good, but as the amount of data we are collecting is huge (sometimes about 300MiB per minute) the Cassandra database should only hold the most recent few hours of data.My question now is: If someone looks at the data, finds something interesting and creates a snapshot of a dashboard or panel (or a certain event occurrs and a snapshot is taken automatically), and the original data is deleted from Cassandra, can the snapshot still be viewed?

I'm devising the best approach for Prometheus to send an alert to my e-mail if authentication to the API ever fails. I'm thinking of using a gauge, initializing it as 0, and if authentication ever fails, increase the gauge value to 1 -- which will then fire off an alert that monitors the value of the gauge (if gauge > 0, fire an alert).Once authentication succeeds, I'll revert the value of the gauge back to 0.Is this typically how custom alerts are created in Prometheus?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["Probably not the best approach. One extreme situation is let's say you have 100 authentications per minute, with 99 of them failing and Prometheus scraping once a minute, immediately after the one successful authentication. You'd have 99% failure rate and never find out about it.If on the other hand you increment a counter for every authentication failure, you can take arate()over the past few minutes (to work around any failed/delayed scrapes) and will definitely know whether there were any authentication failures during the past few minutes.As for the alert, you can set it up to fire whenever that rate goes above 0 (probably not ideal, as there will always be the random failure) or over some non-zero threshold. Plus, optionally add conditions on the number of total authentication requests (100% of one request is different from 50% of 1000 requests) and/or the duration for which the condition has to hold (i.e. there may be one API user that uses the wrong credentials and all their requests fail, but all over a few seconds vs. one authentication failing every few seconds).

Here are a few of of these shapes:How can this ever happen? I suspect it's because the time series spikes at a few points (e.g. to approx. 25 K at approx. 10:30) and that these values are included in the graph in some instances but not others perhaps due to the  period shown by Grafana shifting at \"odd\" offsets relative to new recorded metrics arriving in Prometheus.In any case, this makes the output hard to read and the current graph almost useless for monitoring. I am wondering if this is an instance of a more general, perhaps known problem and if so, what is the best way to overcome it so that the same graph shifts from right to left but does not otherwise change its shape unexpectedly.UPDATEThisdiscussion seems to concern a similar problem with hint at a similar suspected cause. My time series measures octets received per second (as reported by an operating system tool), and although I control the  exporter that feeds it into Prometheus, it's not unclear to me how it could be fed into a counter (instead of a gauge), so the suggested solution does not readily apply.\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["This is an aliasing problem.

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI have a few clients that push their metrics toPushgateway, which then gets scraped byPrometheus. Finally I useGrafanafor dashboards - not a too exotic setup I guess.What puzzles me is when one of the clients stops working and no longer pushes it's metrics, the Pushgateway will further provide the last values it received to Prometheus, and Grafana will happily display a horizontal line.However I'd prefer receiving an alarm if the metrics are too old.

Now it is easy to further filter and  alarm if the value exceeds a defined threshold.

You may set that explicitly to your scrape interval (or less, to make sure you don't lose any samples due to jitter in the scrape interval, although that may end up being costly), but if you increase your dashboard range enough you'll:(a) likely have a singlestat max value that's higher than anything on the graph (because your graph is now lower resolution than the singlestat source data); and(b) will hit Prometheus' 11K samples limit if you zoom out to a range longer than 11K times the scrape interval.Your best bet is to use PromQL to calculate the max value to display in your singlestat panel. You'll still have to deal with (a) above (low resolution graph when the range is long) but it's going to be the actual max (as much as the fact that you're actually sampling values at some fixed interval allows) and it's going to be more efficient.Problem is that given your query --sum(jvm_thread_count)-- there is no way of putting that into a single PromQL query withmax_over_time. You'd have to define a recorded rule (something likeinstance:jvm_thread_count:sum = sum(jvm_thread_count)and then have your singlestat panel display the results of themax_over_time(instance:jvm_thread_count:sum[$__range_s])instant query (check theInstantcheckbox in your singlestat settings)."]]}

In these cases the WAL data with recently collected samples (up to 2 hours) isn't stored in a persistent block, so it becomes lost.Prometheus tries replaying WAL (e.g. recovering data from WAL) on the next start, but it may fail to do so if WAL data is corrupted due to the previous unclean shutdown of the Prometheus.

For example, theincrease()function is basically a per-secondrate()multiplied by the number of seconds in the interval. With such formula and possible missing data points, an accurate result is rather an exception than a normal thing.The reason why it is so is that Prometheus exchanges accuracy for performance and reliability. It doesn't really matter if your server actual CPU usage is 86.3% instead of 86.4%, but it does matter whether you can get this information instantly. Prometheus even have this statement in theirdocs:Prometheus values reliability. You can always view what statistics are available about your system, even under failure conditions. If you need 100% accuracy, such as for per-request billing, Prometheus is not a good choice as the collected data will likely not be detailed and complete enough. In such a case you would be best off using some other system to collect and analyze the data for billing, and Prometheus for the rest of your monitoring.That being said, if you really need accurate values consider using something else. You can for example store logs and count lines (Grafana Loki,The Elastic Stack), or maybe write and retrieve this information from a traditional database with your own solution."]]}

For simplicity, let's assume that the errors are always in the form of X/X+1/X.I've thought of using delta() as if this metric were a gauge, but we can't do that, because in some scenarios it actually resets to 0 as counters normally do, and delta() won't understand it.Fixing the exporter is out of scope.\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["increase()function in Prometheus doesn't provide the ability to gracefully handle small spikes in counter metrics.

Many times I actually use both of these methods in combination for a given alert, which has helped me catch a lot of issues before alerts land in production.You can write unit tests for your alerting rules and run them viapromtool. It will let you manually specify input series (which can be whatever you want) and compare actual vs expected alerts.Official docs:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/There's also an article here:https://www.robustperception.io/unit-testing-alerts-with-prometheusIf you want to deploy real alerts to a few different places with some parameters changed, that's a great use case for a data templating language. There's a relatively popular way of doing that, by creating a \"mixin\" with theJsonnetlanguage. This lets you write your alerts once, but parameterize them for each environment.There are a lot of resources & examples here:https://monitoring.mixins.dev/I imagine you could also do this same sort of thing with CUE or a normal language like Python, however Jsonnet is the most widely used in this particular case. Beware that the learning curve is pretty steep, but it's very powerful for a multitude of use-cases once you get the hang of it."]]}

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI have requirement to collect data of when a device goes up or down and then show that data in a nice graph along with some statistics like availability (%) in last 7 days or number of devices that had less than 95% availability in the last 7 days.I was thinking of using Prometheus with Graphana. But my research and demo programs shows that Prometheus uses a pull model - the data is scraped at regular intervals. If device goes up and down within the same scan interval, this cannot be captured by Prometheus using a \"gauge\" meter. Is this the expected behavior? or have I understood the concepts wrong and doing it wrongly?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["If device goes up and down within the same scan interval, this cannot be captured by Prometheus using a \"gauge\" meter. Is this the expected behavior?Yes, it is expected behavior.Prometheus, as most of the monitoring tools, don't provide real-time monitoring.or have I understood the concepts wrong and doing it wrongly?You understood concept correctly,  but maybe have wrong expectations of the tool.Precision of avaliablity statistics depends heavily on scrape interval and downtime duration, independently of pull or push model.If you have really short restart intervals, they are most likely wouldn't be detected by Prometheus. You could consider lowering scrape interval or exposing additional metric containing last restart timestamp.If restarts of your device could happen in \"bursts\", and you'd like to register every reboot event, I'd suggest looking into push-based monitoring systems, allowing pushing metrics right after reboot."]]}

The data points are usually a few days apart.\nMy goal is to create a bar graph with value increase per day. For the missing values, linear interpolation will do just fine.I've come up withSELECT spread(\"value\") FROM \"gas\" WHERE $timeFilter GROUP BY time(1d) fill(linear)but this won't work as thefill(linear)command is executed AFTER thespread(value)command. If I use time periods much greater than my granularity of input data (e.g. time(14d)), it shows proper bars, but once I use smaller periods, the bars collapse to 0.How can I apply the interpolation BEFORE the difference operation?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["Described situation by you is caused by fact that fill() fills data only if you do not have anything in your group by time() period in your query. If you get spread=0 then you probably have only one value in this period, so no fill() is used.\nWhat I can suggest to you is to use subquery with lower group period time to prepare interpolation of your original signal. This is an example:SELECT spread(\"interpolated_value\") FROM (\n  SELECT first(\"value\") as \"interpolated_value\" from \"gas\" \n  WHERE $timeFilter \n  GROUP BY time(10s) fill(linear)\n) \nGROUP BY time(1d) fill(none)Subquery will prepare value for each 10s period (I recommend to set this value possibly as high as you can accept). If in 10s periods are values, it will pick the first one, if there is no value in this period, it will do an interpolation.In main query there is an usage from prepared interpolated set of values to calculate spread.All above only describes how you can get interpolated data within shorted periods. I strongly recommend to think about usability of this data. Calculating spread from lineary interpolated data may have questionable reliability."]]}

(E.g. you can take the increase over the desired intervalplusscrape_intervaland then adjust by dividing by the length of this interval and multiplying by the desired interval.)The deeper problem is aliasing and there's not much you can do about that. Basically, because Prometheus is sampling your counter everyxseconds/minutes you can't actually know the increase for any time range other than exactly between the instants those samples were collected. (And when you're asking Prometheus forrate(x[1m])you're actually asking for the increase between exactlynowandnowminus 1 minute, which will likely not align with any collected samples.) Not to mention there's jitter due to network latency, load, etc.This latter issue doesn't excuse though (IMHO) PromQL's implementation ofrate()andincrease()and you should be able to get better numbers than what Prometheus is giving you.

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI'm using service discovery in Prometheus using Consul, and it's working well for the most part.  I have exporters running on my nodes, Consul agents running on these same nodes, and I've registered the exporter services in the Consul cluster via the agents (using REST calls to the agents).  Prometheus is correctly finding the registered exporters and scraping the metrics.  Also, Prometheus correctly sends an alarm when the registered service (exporter) is taken down.  But...the problem is that when a node loses a Consul agent (either just the agent process OR the whole node goes down), the Consul cluster no longer sees the node at all!  Then, Prometheus doesn't even know about the node, and therefore doesn't even try to scrape its exporter metrics.  So, I don't get an alert.  In other words, when an agent goes down on a node, it just disappears and I don't even know about it.  I've tried \"leave_on_terminate\": false in the agent's agent.json config, but that doesn't make a difference.Yes, I know I can use DNS service records for service discovery as well, which would keep the node visible in Prometheus even when a Consul agent goes down, but then I'd be double-scraping metrics all the rest of the time when the agent is up.  I want to stick to only using the Consul paradigm for service discovery, and not mix the DNS service record approach in there as well.  I'd also like to avoid monitoring the agents separately (i.e. via blackbox exporter).Any ideas?  Please help.  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["We figured this out on this end.  Everything is working now.Summary of solution: While having '\"leave_on_terminate\": false' in the agent.json config in the agent containers did allow the Consul cluster to show red when the agent container went down on a node (the original problem), Prometheus then just silently stopped scraping metrics on that node --and wouldn't alert (new problem with the same effect as the original problem).  We ended up using the consul-exporter on the nodes as well, to post metrics on the node's consul agent.  With that, Prometheus still wasn't alerting when taking down a Consul agent, but the consul-exporter metrics showed that it was down.  We therefore added a Prometheus rule in the Consul part of the rules.yml config to raise an alert when the consul-exporter metrics showed the Consul agent was down.  This worked end-to-end."]]}

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nI have a requirement to put a Prometheus alert if number of major GCs per min for a spring boot application exceeds to a certain number.\nI am trying to write Prometheus query for that.I got to know one metric namedjvm_gc_collection_seconds_sumbut this metric is no longer available after spring boot 2.Any other way in certain query to get this data?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["In Spring Boot 2.x, the metrics related to garbage collection (GC) have been changed and are no longer available under thejvm_gc_collection_seconds_summetric name. Instead, Spring Boot 2.x uses Micrometer as the metrics library, which provides a different set of metric names.To monitor the number of major GCs per minute for your Spring Boot application, you can use the following Prometheus query:rate(jvm_gc_pause_seconds_count{gc=\"G1 Young Generation\"}[1m])This query calculates the rate of increase in the count of GC pauses in the G1 Young Generation over the last 1 minute. Thejvm_gc_pause_seconds_countmetric represents the total number of GC pauses for a specific garbage collector algorithm, and thegclabel specifies the type of GC. In this case, it's set to \"G1 Young Generation\" to capture major GCs.You can configure the threshold for the number of major GCs per minute that triggers an alert in Prometheus. For example, if you want to alert when the rate exceeds 10 major GCs per minute, you can modify the query as follows:rate(jvm_gc_pause_seconds_count{gc=\"G1 Young Generation\"}[1m]) > 10This query will return a boolean result (trueorfalse) indicating whether the rate of major GCs per minute exceeds 10 or not. You can use this query as an alerting condition in Prometheus to trigger an alert.Please note that the exact metric names and labels may vary depending on the garbage collector used by your Spring Boot application, so make sure to adjust them accordingly."]]}

I checked to see if theprometheus_clientpackage in python had any way to query on that, but the closest thing I found was to parse the text-formatted metrics to gauge/counter objects in python, and if I wished to query on them I would have to implement something my self.I've searched for available solutions, but the only way to query Prometheus I found was through the API, which needs me to push the metrics into the main Prometheus instance.I don't have direct access to the main Prometheus instance, thus I can't make a quick script to push metrics into it.Finally, my question is: How can I perform PromQL queries on Prometheus text-formatted metrics in a text file?

{"prompt": "User: 你是一个 DevOps 技术专家，请回答下面这个问题：\nWhich prometheus metrics type to use for reporting cart order / purchase amount? Should I use gauge or histogram?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["The needed metric type depends on the type of reports you need from thepurchasing amountmetric.For example, if you want to know the total amount of purchases over arbitrary period of time, then you need to use acounter, which must be incremented whenever new purchase is made. The counter may contain additional labels if finer-grained reports are needed. For example, it may containshoplabel if you want receiving purchasing stats individually per each shop. Or it may containproduct_idlabel if you need per-product purchasing stats. Note that too fine-grained label can lead tohigh cardinality issues.If you want to know the distribution of purchasing amounts across purchases, then you need to usehistogram.Note that you can use both histograms and counters if you need both report types."]]}

What I want to achieve is to trigger alert if ratio of produced to consumed messages drop below 1.Unfortunately it is impossible to use prometheus, for two reasons:\n1) counter resets each time service is restarted.\n2) second service doesn't have (and wont't have in reasonable time) prometheus integration.Question is how to approach metrics and alerting based on that data sources?

Moreover, check the tutorials for your specific version of elasticsearch. From 5.x to 7.x setting alerts has been significantly improved (this means that for 7.x you might be able to do this via the UI of kibana, but for 5.x you'll probably need to add the alert via indexing json in the appropriate indices.watcher)I haven't used grafana, but I believe the same approach can be applied.

Maybe the condition iswhen a document exists in the heartbeat-index with field X having value Y(e.g. checking if there was an http-code XXX).So to sum it up:Yes, you can configure that via Elasticsearch's Watcher-Feature.

However, Prometheus takes that 24 hour range too literally and it only looks at samples falling within those 24 hours. Seeing as how your samples are 24 hours apart, that's one sample on average. And since you can't compute an increase based on a single sample, you likely get nothing most of the time.There's no reasonable way of getting what you expect out of Prometheus unless you \"reverse engineer\" it. I.e. either take the increase over 48 hours (so there are on average 2 samples) and then adjust for the extrapolation Prometheus does (i.e. divide by 2; which may or may not be necessary with ranges over 5 minutes).Or you can useirate(query[48h]) * 24 * 3600, which is basically the per-second change rate between the last 2 samples (what you want) multiplied by the number of seconds in a day.
