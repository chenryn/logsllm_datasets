Until now, all my targets (nodes and containers) lived on the same network as the monitoring server.But now I'm facing a scenario, where we will deploy our application stack (as a bunch of Docker containers) to several client machines in thier networks. Nearly all of the clients networks are behind a firewall or NAT. So scraping becomes quite difficult.As we're still accountable for our stack, I'd like to have a central montioring server, altering and dashboards.I was wondering what could be the best architecture if want to implement it with Prometheus, but I couldn't find any convincing approaches. My ideas so far:Use a Pushgatewayon our side and push all data out of the client networks. As the docs state, it's not intended that way:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/Use a federation setup(https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/): Place a Prometheus server in every client network behind a reverse proxy (to enable SSL and authentication) and aggregate relevant metricts there.

Now i created a docker image of my application and i'm able to run my software as docker container.Using docker i also log to stdout (console-appender) to get the application logs into docker (docker logs {containerId}).Now i ask myself wether i could spare on the gelf log4j2-appender and use instead a docker log-driver/plugin for gelf. (seehttps://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/)What's the best practice here?I think using the docker log plugin would send the whole string message to graylog and graylog would need to extract the meta information from that string (so i need to provide this meta data within the log message, for example the log_level). This may cause more resource consumption on graylog side and it's also not possible to configure docker for sending only error messages to graylog. This leads to more network traffic. Using the log4j2 gelf-appender i'm able to provide some meta data additional to the log message without including it in the main log message and there wouldn't be an extraction needed on graylog side.

{"prompt": "User: 下面是一个stackoverflow 问题描述，请总结成一句话：\nOur team has written a docker image. We want to receive an alert if the pod running this image fails. (For this we are using Prometheus's alert manager andkube-state-metrics).Adifferentteam is creating the job that runs that image (note they're doing it via something akin toargo). In order to get the alert we want, we are asking that team to include a specific label i.e. the pod created by the job will have a label we can use in promql to create an alert when that pod fails.The only way we can think of enforcing that the correct label is used is to check for this label from within the container, and fail with a error message telling us the label is missing. So either via a downward API (but that is another requirement for the team running the job), or more likely by just runningkubectl get pods -l ...since this container already useskubectlfor something else.There is a debate in our team if this is a bad practice. Is it an anti-pattern for a container to insist on a pod label?

I could imagine setting up a Prometheus instance during deployment, feeding it with some metric samples (worrying how would I do that with the Pull-architecture of Prometheus?) and then running queries against it.The only thing I found so far is ablog post about monitoring the Prometheus Alertmanager chain as a wholerelated to the third category.Has anyone done something like that or is there anything I missed?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["How to automatically test Prometheus alerts?"]]}

I'm devising the best approach for Prometheus to send an alert to my e-mail if authentication to the API ever fails. I'm thinking of using a gauge, initializing it as 0, and if authentication ever fails, increase the gauge value to 1 -- which will then fire off an alert that monitors the value of the gauge (if gauge > 0, fire an alert).Once authentication succeeds, I'll revert the value of the gauge back to 0.Is this typically how custom alerts are created in Prometheus?\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["Prometheus: What's the best way to alert on a condition?"]]}

Here are a few of of these shapes:How can this ever happen? I suspect it's because the time series spikes at a few points (e.g. to approx. 25 K at approx. 10:30) and that these values are included in the graph in some instances but not others perhaps due to the  period shown by Grafana shifting at \"odd\" offsets relative to new recorded metrics arriving in Prometheus.In any case, this makes the output hard to read and the current graph almost useless for monitoring. I am wondering if this is an instance of a more general, perhaps known problem and if so, what is the best way to overcome it so that the same graph shifts from right to left but does not otherwise change its shape unexpectedly.UPDATEThisdiscussion seems to concern a similar problem with hint at a similar suspected cause.

The AIX servers push their metrics (in json) to a central listener (the exporter program) that converts them to standard Prometheus metrics and exposes them for scraping.The issue I have is that the hostname for the metrics is extracted from the pushed json.

The Prometheus relabelling happens before the scrape so the lpar label isn't there to be relabelled.One option seems to be to rewrite the exporter so that the Prometheus server probes defined targets, each target being the lpar.  In order for that to work, I'd need a means to filter the stored metrics by lpar so only metrics relating to the target/lpar are returned.

The experiments, were conducted using prometheus and thanos. Most can be done with those, but I feel that the back in time timestamp is somewhat hackish.

{"prompt": "User: 下面是一个stackoverflow 问题描述，请总结成一句话：\nI'm using service discovery in Prometheus using Consul, and it's working well for the most part.  I have exporters running on my nodes, Consul agents running on these same nodes, and I've registered the exporter services in the Consul cluster via the agents (using REST calls to the agents).  Prometheus is correctly finding the registered exporters and scraping the metrics.  Also, Prometheus correctly sends an alarm when the registered service (exporter) is taken down.  But...the problem is that when a node loses a Consul agent (either just the agent process OR the whole node goes down), the Consul cluster no longer sees the node at all!  Then, Prometheus doesn't even know about the node, and therefore doesn't even try to scrape its exporter metrics.  So, I don't get an alert.  In other words, when an agent goes down on a node, it just disappears and I don't even know about it.  I've tried \"leave_on_terminate\": false in the agent's agent.json config, but that doesn't make a difference.Yes, I know I can use DNS service records for service discovery as well, which would keep the node visible in Prometheus even when a Consul agent goes down, but then I'd be double-scraping metrics all the rest of the time when the agent is up.  I want to stick to only using the Consul paradigm for service discovery, and not mix the DNS service record approach in there as well.  I'd also like to avoid monitoring the agents separately (i.e. via blackbox exporter).Any ideas?  Please help.  Thanks!\n\nAssistant:", "response": [["How can I keep a node visible to Prometheus via Consul service discovery when that node's agent goes down?"]]}

{"prompt": "User: 下面是一个stackoverflow 问题描述，请总结成一句话：\nI know our data might be the problem.   But I'm asking anyways.We are using Prometheus to gather data from within our Kubernetes cluster.  It appears that some of our metrics have multiple entries for some and overlapping timestamps, but some slightly different labels included in the metric.  This causes the \"sum by\" function to add those duplicate timestamps to appear to be double.Real simple example:metric  time   labels                          value\n\ncpu     1      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"http\"      1\ncpu     2      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"http\"      1\ncpu     3      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"http\"      .5\ncpu     4      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"http\"      1\ncpu     5      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"http\"      .5\n\ncpu     3      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"https\"     .5\ncpu     4      pod=\"app1\",endpoint=\"https\"     1These are very simple example, but hopefully enough to show the issue.When I do something like:sum(max_over_time(cpu{pod=\"app1\"}[24h:5m])) by(pod)I end up getting the max of (2), where it adds (sum) both of the time(4)'s together.  I would expect the max to come back as (1).I would be great if it could combine both series, take the max of either, then use that one.
